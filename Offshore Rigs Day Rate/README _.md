## Table of Contents
Model development is divided into multiple steps as mentioned below,

*   Data exploring and understanding: This step involves preliminary level data understanding and exploring.
*   Data Cleaning: This step includes cleaning the existing data. We check the data for any missing values and treat them as per the requirements. We also need to look for constant value colulmns as that is not going to add any additional value to out analysis. Sometimes columns with very high proportion of any particular value also doesn't add any values. Hence, getting rid of them helps with further analysis.
*   Data Visualization: This step involves visualizing our dataset and check for relationship amongst independent variables. We can also reduce some feature columns here but it should not be aggressive.
*   Data Preparation: This step is mainly usefull for feeding in the data into the model. It involves steps like creating dummy variables, scaling etc. depending upond the data type.
*   Model Development-validation and evaluaiton: This steps involves training the model and validate it. It involves evaluating the model using relevant matrics.
*   Conclusion/Recommendation: It involves drawing conclusions and recommendations to business.
