9,1,Positive,Got as a surprise for my husband there is nothing special about it just a lube save the money and get plain KY if you just need a lube wish I could return it for a refund
11,1,Positive,Purchased this thinking it would have some sort of warming effect but it's the same as the original. Don't waste your money.
14,1,Positive,First time purchase of this type of product. Maybe I expected too much. Did not think there was any warming feeling at all. Left us sticky! Even after trying to was it off.
54,1,Positive,"I used (and loved) this product for several years until they changed it. It used to moisturize my skin and left it feeling soft. Now, it sits on top of my skin and is never absorbed. It just leaves a slimy film on my skin. I will no longer purchase this product."
56,1,Positive,"I am so disappointed! I have used this product for years because of it's soft smell and great results. The new formula feels greasy, smells awful and I don't feel like my skin looks as toned and wrinkle free anymore. This was a five star product for so many years...why change it Please bring back the old formula."
58,1,Positive,"It took me so long to find a moisturizer that worked well for me and I loved this product. However, this new formula has a smell that is too strong for me and feels very greasy once applied. Unfortunately I will no longer be purchasing this product and will have to search again for another moisturizer. Please Olay, bring back your old formula. It was so much better."
60,1,Positive,Olay don't work for me I have overly dry skin. I haven't found anything to work on my skin. So I'm hoping to be able to find something that will work. But I'm affrid I won't be able to find anything to help my skin not be so dry. It gets so bad the I dig at my legs all the time.
64,2,Positive,"While this product probably does leave faces feeling nourished, I would not recommend using it as a daily moisturizer under makeup. It left my face full of crumbles as soon as I brushed on my makeup. Would probably be better as a night cream."
66,2,Positive,GreatGreatmefeels great smells great succulent took away dry skin silky smooth enriching
688,1,Positive,"Leaves windows with streaks, although it does seem to work OK on other surfaces."
689,1,Positive,it leaves streaks bad . i used windsheild washer fluid in spray bottle to clean off windex. now clean!
690,1,Positive,Very disappointed in this product. It leaves all kinds of streaks no matter how many times you wash your windows. A 50/50 mixture of white vinegar and water is much better.
692,1,Positive,"Having used Windex for years , I noticed in the last year or so, a VERY different result when I clean my windows. I have had to go over them 2-3 times and still they have a streaky film not seen before. What's going on I have now resorted to light soap with a lemon water rinse and my windows sparkle. You have lost a very loyal customer and I am not alone, though I can now spend that money on lemons !"
693,1,Positive,"Despite the long reputation this product has had as a top glass cleaner, it no longer gets the job done. Too often I find streaks and smudges appear on the mirrors within hours of cleaning. It doesn't matter if I use a paper towel, newspaper, or lint-free cloth. Windex's 'streak-free shine' is a false advertisement if you ask me. This is no longer my choice glass cleaner."
694,1,Positive,"I have used windex for many years (only because my family introduced me to the product) and always been unhappy with the film/streaks it leaves on the glass. I have to go back over it several times and i still can't get rid of the film/streaks. I use paper towels and even with cloth, streaks of film are left. I'm testing other products in order to find something better."
696,1,Positive,I have yet to buy a glass cleaner that doesn't leave streaks and this one failed also. I have switched to plain water in a spray bottle for my mirrors and it is amazing how they shine. Try it. Better for the environment too.
698,1,Positive,"I've used Windex for 30 years and not sure what has changed but no doubt something to cut costs, increase profits. Definitely not the original cleaner. This product no longer works. Leaves streaks and film and no matter how much you apply or repeat clean, seems to only get worse! Finally used water which worked better. So frustrating."
700,1,Positive,"I have used Windex original for over 50 years and have always loved it. Now I clean windows, mirrors and glass topped tables and have nothing but streaks. I thought it was my cloth so changed it to everyone available plus paper towels and still streaks. What did you do to my favorite glass cleaner"
701,1,Positive,"I used all windex products for years. Now all the cleaners , not just windex, leave a smeary residue. I have tried newspaper, unprint newspaper for packing and many types of cleaning cloths, as well as paper towels. I noticed this happening about 2 years ago. What has happened to the formula."
702,1,Positive,"Have tried windex with a squeegee, microfiber cloth, newsprint, two different types of paper towel. No matter what I do, how many times I wash it, there are always gross streaks. In fact, it seems like every time I apply windex, the streaks get worse. I'm looking for another window cleaner."
703,1,Positive,Washed my car windows 4 times using different paper towels and lint free cloths. Could not get the windows clean. Ended up using ammonia and water and got most of the streaks off on the fifth time! I used Windex Complete and will never use it again. Streaked the bathroom mirrors too.
706,1,Positive,"I've used Windex all my life and while it's not streak-free, it did an adequate job. But lately, my windows are covered with a white haze in blotches. I have to go back over and over to get them clean. This is not the original Windex - what have you done to it"
708,1,Positive,"I have been using the Windex/Multisurface with vinegar for years and have always had very good results. I went looking for another bottle when I ran out and noticed that the packaging has changed. I purchased a bottle and also noticed another thing, the quality has changed as well. When I used it on my mirrors they were all smudged. I did not get that usual streak free shine that I usually get with this particular product. I have enjoyed using your Windex/Multisurface, vinegar product in the past and have always passed over the less expensive brands to purchase this particular product because I knew it's quality. If this is the product that you will be producing, I will no longer be a consumer. I understand that you have to find ways to keep things cost effective for your company as well as the consumers,but please maintain your quality."
709,1,Positive,"I've used this product for many years and was very happy with it. But in the last year I find it streaks and leaves a dull finish. At first I thought maybe it had froze during shipment, but then I repurchased it several times and it still not the same has it use to be. AND don't tell me I'm using it wrong or it's the operator because it is NOT. I've also read the reviews and I'm not the only one complaining about this product. I gave it a very low rating because I KNOW it use to be a good product. Something has changed whether it's the way it's produced or the ingredients. But I will not be purchasing any more of this. I can do better with vinegar and water and it's not has costly and I don't have to waste time trying to get it to not streak or dull up within a day or two.."
711,1,Positive,"I used Windex Original on my glass top kitchen table and all I could see was a smeary haze. I tried it two more times and it was still hazy. The forth time instead of a paper towel I used a clean cotton dish rag - still smears. I had been cleaning both top and undersides of the table. When I tried windex on a nearby window, it seemed to work fine. I wonder if the previous cleaner had left a residual My husband who has more muscle is going to reclean the glass top bottom. If microfiber cloth is required,you should put that on the label. I clean my table 3 or 4 times a day - I NEED SOMETHING THAT WORKS."
712,1,Positive,"This product is no where near working successfully in cleaning windows. To my disappointment the home remedies that I had used before trying this worked 100 better. No matter how I approach the cleaning, it just leaves streaks and film. In years past Windex was used and it seemed to have worked better than the current bottle. Biggest disappointment is that I just bought a one gallon refill!"
714,1,Positive,"I just tried to clean normal interior film off the windshield of my wife's car. The result was some residual film after I tried to use this product twice. Based upon recent experience with Windex Original on other cars I own with the same poor results, I'm done using this product. This has been my go-to for years, but I give up! I don't care about cost, I'll find something that works the way Windex did in the past and I'll buy it."
716,1,Positive,I have now purchased two different 23 oz bottles of the Windex Orignial within 4 weeks of each other. The spray trigger broke off on the first bottle after about 4 uses. I still had 80 of the bottle left. So I went and purchased a second 23 oz bottle with the intentions of switching out the tops so that I could use the rest of the first bottle. After one use (cleaned 4 windows and a mirrow) the trigger from the second bottle broke too. Now I am stuck with two almost completely full bottles of windex and no way to clean. I will be looking for a new brand...
717,1,Positive,"We've stuck to the Original for decades after something that was either called dripless or streak free left streaks. NOW, our bottle of Original Streak Free Shine with Ammonia-D left disheartening streaks on our glass coffe table and glass dining table. I finally got the streaks off by wiping carefully with water and removing the water beads carefully - making quite a task for me. - QUESTION: is what we bought truly the ORIGINAL or is it the original streak free Otherwise, why are we getting streaks"
718,1,Positive,"I have used Windex for years, always wondering why I kept using it. I have never had a streak-free window, even after going over it multiple times. I have tried newspaper, paper towels, cloths, everything I can think of and still it leaves streaks. I just started cleaning my windows again. They are heavy to lift out. I cleaned my first window, checked again and cleaned again before putting it back in, Out comes the sun and shows up all the streaks. I guess I would rather have dirt windows, Never again will I use Windex!"
719,1,Positive,"Like many others I have been using Windex for years and have been happy with it. Recently, however, it seems to be leaving a streaky film. I use the same kind of lint free cloth as ever so I can only conclude the formula has changed. I note that others are reporting the same problem with the film. Has the formula changed"
720,1,Positive,"I have used Windex for over 35 years and have been happy for most of that time. While I don't know what changes Windex has recently made, I am severely, repeat severely, disappointed in Windex product offerings (including Windex Original and other newer versions of Windex). I am so disappointed that I have recently been making my own solution. It works significantly better than Windex. While I know you want to maximize profits, you should be able to make make a product that works."
723,1,Positive,I have many glass surfaces in my home and windex is a regular on my shopping list. The last bottle I purchased must be a different formula. Everything I use it on is a streaky mess. I actually made a quick store run to buy a different product when a friend text that she was stopping by. If the quality of this Johnson family product isn't restored they should discontinue it. Who has time for cleaning products that cause extra work!
725,1,Positive,"I have used Windex in the original formula for many years. Always worked great. Now all I can find is Windex Complete. Aptly named, it is a complete failure. Does not clean car windows, nor other glass well. Leaves streaks that can only be minimised by immediately wiping with a dry paper towel, and even then cot completely. Give me back my original formula. I am currently searching for another product I am so disappointed."
728,1,Positive,I have now purchased two different 23 oz bottles of the Windex Orignial within 4 weeks of each other. The spray trigger broke off on the first bottle after about 4 uses. I still had 80 of the bottle left. So I went and purchased a second 23 oz bottle with the intentions of switching out the tops so that I could use the rest of the first bottle.

I will be looking for a new brand...
729,1,Positive,"Twice now ever since they introduced the new sprayer bottle, after the very first couple quick squeezes the new flimsy squeezer snaps off, rendering the bottle useless.. these used to last forever and we would just buy bulk refills... is this some idea from some new guy hired to save money idea to make hem break easier so you buy more, oris it just shoddy design I've purchased a noname glass cleaner sprayer (it was cheaper than buying a new empty sprayer bottle) and will refill with windex left overs, then continue buying no name glass cleaner.... who cares how good it cleans if the sprayer breaks instantly... i am sure some new marketing guy got a bonus and a pat on the back for saving a few cents on a inferior spray nozzle"
730,1,Positive,"I have been a faithful Windex user for over 40 years ... but the last couple of years I've noticed more and more that it does not clean like it used to. My mirrors were always sparkling clean, but now I have a film and streaks that will not come off. I even went back over them with a clean dry paper towel and there were faint blue smudges on the paper towel. That tells me that Windex is leaving a residue on the glass ... which leads to streaks .... which is frustrating. Recently remodeled the bathroom and we have lots of mirrors, but now they are a hot mess. Will be trying new cleaners - or using vinegar and water."
733,1,Positive,"I have to agree with Mel. Used to be a great product. I am curious as to what the changes were that SC Johnson made to the product, that Heather refers to."
737,1,Positive,New cap design - How tdo you put it in spray mode There are no mode indicators on the nozzle.
738,2,Positive,This is a great windex product that I came across after a long time.Please try once and then believe me.
741,2,Positive,"I love Windex!!! Everyone who knows me knows this! However, you guys have messed up perfection. Stop messing up what is already good. Stop trying to cut cost..."
742,2,Positive,This is a great windex product that I came across after a long time.Please try once and then believe me.
743,2,Positive,I have used Windex forever. The last couple of bottles have left streaks everywhere. Even the Windex that is sold on cloths in packages does this. (So I know it is not my paper towels). Has anything changed in the formula Could it just be Windex sold in California We have lots of regulations here prohibiting this and that. Please help. A couple of years ago I would have given the product an excellent review. Thank you!
745,2,Positive,"Why was the sprayer nozzle changed It worked perfect the way it was, now the nozzle sticks in the down position. Takes too long to clean with this, I'll look for something different. I like Windex, but hate the new sprayer."
746,2,Positive,"Windex doesn't clean mirrors, glass like it used to. Leaves streaks. Works somewhat better than last brand tried so bought again. Got home and it won't spray. Nozzle front won't turn at all and nothing else works to open it. I shouldn't have to buy spray bottle for something that comes in a spray bottle."
747,2,Positive,Maybe i am picky but after cleaning i see a film and cloudy streaky result. I have used this product for many years and don't want to change if i don't have to. Mirrors and windows used to look like new but not lately.
748,2,Positive,I have used windex all of my life. I have 5 foot windows throughout my home and have always prided myself on the cleanliness of my windows. I purchased three bottles of this windex and everyone of my windows and mirrors have streaks that look as if my windows haven't been cleaned in months. What is the new ingredient in the Glass and More cleaner that is creating this. Maybe you should consider bottling a JUST GLASS CLEANER and stop trying to be everything to everyone. Two days of hard work down the drain and I don't know how to correct the problem. Help
749,2,Positive,"As so many of the other reviews have suggested, it definitely seems as though something has changed. I can't get it to stop streaking. I have used Windex for as long as I can remember for everything. I primarily use Windex original. I'm not exactly sure when I started having issues. Probably the last year or so. I tried changing paper towels and using a clean lint free rag with no improvement. It's been driving me crazy. No matter how many times I spray and wipe my mirrors, windows, appliances and our glass top tables there are still streaks. Disappointingly I'm going to start trying other product."
1038,2,Positive,"Not being a Kind Bar aficionado, I didn't know how widely different each type of Kind Bar is...I expected the same full flavor and fulfillment of the long thin Kind Bars. These are flat, square and rather bland. The dark chocolate adds some flavor but still nothing I was excited about. They do the trick in keeping hunger at bay, but they are not what I expected."
1072,1,Positive,"I have very oily, fine hair and this shampoo just made my hair look dirtier than before washing it. My hair was greasy and heavy. I thought maybe I just didn't rinse well enough so I gave it another try a few days later but had the same results. I can say that it smelled good!"
1073,1,Positive,I've used your volume product for years but all of the sudden you removed the 2-in-1 so I switched to this and the conditioner then you changed the shampoo and the conditioner (which wasn't nearly as good as the 2-in-1 but was better than nothing) ! I loved your product but now I have to find another unfortunately nothing you offer compares to the quality you used to have! Why would you change such a great product! I wish you'd bring back the 2-in-1! For me being a man with baby fine hair it was the only product on the market that didn't cause me to lose hair or dry it out and didn't have an over powering feminine scent! I really wish you'd stop messing with good things!
1074,1,Positive,I have been using aussome volume for over 10 years except it used to be called real volume. I would really like to know if you changed the formula for it. The last 6 or so months I've been having scalp problems with sores and my hair falling out. The last couple of bottles I purchased have had a much stronger smell to it and it is drying my hair and scalp out really bad. It never used to do this. It always made my hair really thicker looking and just really nice. Hardly ever had to use conditioner. Please if you could let me know about that I would really appreciate it. I haven't ever thought about switching from Aussie but now I think I have too.
1077,1,Positive,"You changed the smell! The bottle I just used up says the scent is white ginger, the new one says it's jojoba, but it smells like cherries or something. Why in the world have you changed the formula! I've used this for over 10 years, and the smell was always the same, even if the formula was changed. I miss the old smell, it was my favorite. Now I have to find another shampoo with a mild scent that I like. Rude."
1078,1,Positive,"The scent is too strong, it burns your eyes, and leaves your hair very dry. Avoid it. When it comes to shampoo and conditioner you really get what you pay for."
1079,2,Positive,"I received this as a sample from influenster. First, let me say I love the smell. It is fresh and fruity and very good. However, when I was rinsing it out, it took all the 'slip' out of my hair and my hair felt pure straw!!! I am sad, because I loved the smell."
1225,1,Positive,"The product is OK, the scent is barely noticeable. Overpriced"
1263,1,Positive,"I used this on my 2 boys on the 4th of July, ages 5 9. We have a huge block party with water balloons, swimming, playing in sprinklers. The boys were in their suits all day i re-applied several times through out the day, each time I put it on the boys, they were wet. Well at the end of the day, they were also very burned! I used a coppertone on my daughter and she did not get burned at all. I have been telling all my friends NOT to buy this I would never buy it again."
1264,1,Positive,"I have used this sunscreen twice. The first time I got burned, but had been in the water so I thought it was because of that. Today my husband and I both used it, and we are so burned! We were outside for a couple hours and did not get wet at all. I applied it 20 minutes before we went outside and rubbed it in. My husband only used it on part of his body and those parts were just as burned as the areas he did not use it on. I definitely DO NOT recommend this product!!!"
1265,1,Positive,"After applying as directed, we went swimming and then reapplied after an hour. We burned in that one hour! Not only that, but our skin is a rusty orange color! It looks like we sprayed ourselves with a cheap self tan. We have used the regular Neutrogena Sun Block spray and this did not happen. Went for the wet skin bottle this time and it didn't work for us."
1266,1,Positive,"After 1 day of use, I developed a red itchy rash on all areas that were sprayed."
1297,1,Positive,"I am very fair and burn easily in the sun. I was excited to try this product after reading some reviews. I have tried this lotion several times, thinking I was applying it wrong or something. Everytime I use it, It leaves blotches, especially on my arms and chest no matter how much I tried to rub it in evenly. It also took too long to completely dry. If it is not completely dry, you will have lighter spots where your clothes rub your skin or where your arms bend and such. I just cannot stand still for 30 minutes to an hour for the lotion to dry, not touching anything! The color looked pretty orange. It also had a very bad smell after it was left on for a few hours. Also, it washes right off in the shower so don't even think about taking a bath with this because you will be bathing in orange water. The only thing I do like about the lotion is that it gives you color right away and becomes darker over time, but it'd be better if the color wasn't orange. I absolutely HATE this product and I do not recommend it to anyone, especially fair skinned people."
1299,1,Positive,"This is a very fast-acting lotion, I'll give it that. My problem is that after using it for about a week (like it says on the bottle), I turned a color that was more of a yellow/orange than anything else. Run away!!!!!!!"
1300,1,Positive,Have used Summer Color light/medium on my legs according to directions nearly every day for over a month. There has been absolutely no color change. I've had success with other sunless tanning products. Going back to them.
1376,1,Positive,It made a lot of my hair fall out and now instead of sleek my hair looks oily. I absolutely love other Suave products but this one just didn't cut it.
1378,1,Positive,Hi i love this line used since high school. I just bought a new set and it smells different. Should I be concerned or was their a change in suave sleek
1382,1,Positive,I had been using this product off and on for a couple of years and I really loved it. Loved the way it smelled and the way my hair felt. A few months ago I bought it again. This time after the first 2-3 days my scalp became dry and itchy. It was so itchy that I just wanted to scrape my scalp right off. Caused sores on my head that were also very itchy. I began to notice my hairbrush filling up with hair. Was cleaning out every week because my hair was falling out. I thought I had just become allergic to the shampoo and conditioner so I gave it to my daughter. Her and her boyfriend began to use it and their scalps became dry and severely itchy. Suave must have changed the formula. They need to pull this product off the shelves and revamp it. Maybe before selling it again the head honchos should taker it home and use it themselves as well as their families. Then they might be more careful about what they are putting on the shelves for the consumer. Please beware if you use this your head will itch like you have never felt an itch before.
1383,1,Positive,I bought this product and at first i was content with the product. My hair felt clean and fresh but after a few uses i noticed my scalp getting dry and itchy. When i looked at the roots of my hair i noticed the product was burning my scalp and it was peeling!!!.. i stopped using this product and went back to using head and shoulders which i should have never left to try Suave. My scalp is now healing since i moved back. Never again will i use this product that is too harsh.
1384,1,Positive,"I have to say, Suave Professionals Sleek Conditioner for dry or frizzy was the best conditioner I've ever had. It was super affordable and everyone says I smell nice (which is pretty creepy) But, these past 2 days, I noticed something different. The color was different, it felt different, it smelled different, and it wasn't working anymore. I even thought someone was pranking me. So, I decided to search up the old ingredients and compare it to the current conditioner I have. The formula was different. Who ever is responsible for changing the ingredients, PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK! . I really don't want to find a new conditioner because it's so much work. I will change my review to an positive as long as someone does something about the formula."
1385,1,Positive,"My daughter has soft 3b to 3c curls. This product dried her hair so bad that it matted and it took days of oil treatments to get it back to close to normal. My youngest girl had softer wavy hair and this dried her ends. It split them. After the conditioner was rinsed out her ends looked horrible. I came to suave.com for more info and help getting my money back. But I kept getting directed to the home page. I love most Suave products, but this one was a sure miss for us."
1386,1,Positive,Bought the sleek shampoo and conditioner. Opened them this evening to wash my daughters hair and it was as though someone has dumped them BOTH out and filled with water! Highly dissatisfied with these products!
1387,2,Positive,"I like the way it smells and my hair feels nice after its blow drie however, my hair feels super waxy and oily after half a day.. I tried using less conditioner and same result. I might end up using the shampoo only which is a waste of buying the conditioner."
1390,2,Positive,"My wife and I have used Suave Professional shampoos and conditioners for many years. We have always really liked how they worked and consider them the best value available when it comes to shampoo and conditioner. However, the Sleek product that is similar to Matrix caused my scalp to break out in severe acne. I didn't realize it was the the shampoo. Nothing I tried helped and it kept getting worse. I finally stumbled on various comments online when I was doing research trying to figure out what was causing my problem that indicated Matrix caused them a similar problem. I immediately changed shampoos and ten days later, my scalp is almost completely clear. Will go back to the other Suave Professional products as their is something in this product that my body reacts to negatively."
1426,1,Positive,Texture not quite what I've had in other brands. Used it on top of a salad. Slightly fishy smell. Yes it's white tuna. Just not the best part of the fish. I would not use it for tuna salad sandwiches. Probably be okay in a casserole or cooked dish.
1450,1,Positive,"This shelf made of cardboard. The assemble system is just double stick tape, It should not be more than { $ }dollars. it Just looks so cheap."
1451,1,Positive,I got this for my 1 year old daughters room to place fabric bins in. When I recived it the backing was cardboard and the shelves are held together by 3m tape and cardboard pegs. Very cheap looking. I paid way to much for the quality of product. Product is not very sturdy. Very poor prooduct.
1452,1,Positive,The major connections are made with double stick tape. There are no screws to hold the components together. I will be returning this purchase.
1469,1,Positive,"I was not impressed with this product at all, could of used the shampoo and gotten the same results. I was anticipating a prominent original carrot smell and it was lacking. Nourishing I think not!"
1470,1,Positive,I am pretty disappointed with this body wash. It does not lather well and does not leave the skin feeling clean. I also don't like the smell. I have to use a lot of the wash to get a good lather. Will not buy gain.
1471,2,Positive,"I just used this for the first time. It smells great, and was feeling great until I got to my tender bits. Holy wow! Will not do that again. .ow ow ow. Also, they really mean it when they say do not get near your eyes! Packaging has some issues. The top is not attached to the bottle, which made me end up playing catch the lid. Very much like that it's not slippery/slimy like some competitors' comparable product. I love all the other Yes To products I've tried. I think as long as I don't use this on my face and bits, I will like this one, too."
1472,2,Positive,The plastic is soooo dang hard on this bottle that u almost have 2 squeeze the bottle with 2hands... outta line. How can u enjoy a good shower if ur constantly fighting with a bottle of product that suppose 2b nourishing n relaxn. Because of this design flaw i cannot rate any higher. Fix this problem right away. Oh and for the rec'd. i did remove the xtra clear tape on the bottle before use so that had nothing to do with it as some ppl complained.
1537,1,Positive,Movie is fine... But does not include Ultraviolet. Called customer service and I now have to wait for BB to reorder the dvd and I then have to go to UPS to return this copy. This $5 dvd is more like $20-$30 with the additional time I have had to waste and a trip to UPS. Not a good start to holiday shopping.
1539,1,Positive,Did not like this movie. Wasted my money on this Blu Ray DVD set. Would not recommend this movie even if you are a true Johnny Depp fan.
1540,1,Positive,"The preview leads you to believe it's a comedy. With Johnny Depp, I believed it would be good. About half way through, I realized it was not going to get funny. Every humorous scene was in the previews. I gave the disk to my daughter, and told her she could keep it........ she returned it to me the next day, and told me she didn't want it."
1542,1,Positive,dont waste your time was more fun looking out the window watching leaves fall from the tree and have a trash can near you to through up in.
1543,2,Positive,"Johnny Depp did a great job - he is a very talented actor, but in my opinion this movie fell short of my expectations. I didn't realize when I bought it that it was directed by Tim Burton until after. It's the typical weird off-the-wall scattered plot movie. It'd be a one star movie if Depp wasn't in it - he is the only reason the movie was at least bearable to me."
1544,2,Positive,Not one of his best. I should have passed on this one.
1546,2,Positive,"I was a fan of the original as a child. However, what was fun then is not quite as enjoyable as an adult. The movie is quirky, but that is not enough for me to recommend it. Rent it first."
1547,2,Positive,Strange and familiar at the same time Johnny Depp plays Johnny Depp. Burton uses the same sexually repressed dark figure looking to get it in. See it only once and only if you rented it or if someone already owns it.
1550,2,Positive,"I liked it, but I didn't get pulled into the story. And the best jokes were told in the previews."
1786,2,Positive,"I've enjoyed some of Elvis' movies like Viva Las Vegas, Blue Hawaii, and Fun in Acapulco. I received Clambake as a gift to add to my collection, and I thought I'd like it especially because it took place in Miami, where I'm from.Sadly, this was not a very good movie. The late-60s styles were comical, and the young days of Christine from Coach and Bill Bixby from The Hulk were amusing. However, the obvious closed sets, corny acting and oddball music interludes kept me asking why was this movie even produced.The final insult to injury... Elvis and his girl drive into the Florida sunset... with mountains in the background! The only mountains in Miami are trash dumps so this was obviously shot in California and poorly passed off as Miami Beach.So I give it 2 stars: one for Elvis and one for the real Florida."
1788,2,Positive,"There are basically four criteria by which I judge an Elvis movie: the songs and how they relate to the movie's story Elvis' acting performance Elvis' co-stars' performance and the story itself.The songs used in Clambake (especially the title song itself) are not well-written. In fact, they are so forgettable that I can't recall any of them as stand-outs. The best one is probably the one (title) he sings on the beach. The song he co-sings while riding a motorbike in the movie is relatable to the story and it does look like Elvis is into the song. However, I think that speaks more to Elvis' charm as a musical performer. Although if you have ever seen Harum Scarum (and if you have not... I do NOT recommend you do), you will see Elvis at his most UNenthusiastic when it comes to singing the movie's songs. The song he sings to/with the children at the park playground is way too long and seemingly filler material... having little of anything to do with the story.As for Elvis' acting performance, I've seen him give worse performances (Harum Scarum definitely tops the list of other Elvis movies I have seen), but I have also seen better (Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, Viva Las Vegas, to name just three). He definitely held his own in this movie. I'll leave it at that. I don't recall any fight scenes in this movie, which I find/found a refreshing change (it's been a few days since I watched it and have watched other Elvis movies since then).Shelley Fabares (if you remember her from the 80s/90s TV show Coach) was likable as the leading lady in this film. Bill Bixby (later most familiar as David Banner from The Incredible Hulk) played the protagonist well because I didn't like him... which was intentional. Will Hutchins (maybe known from his earlier role in another Elvis movie, Spinout) plays Tom Wilson, the waterski instructor whose identity Elvis' character (Scott Heyward) assumes in the movie... is adequate.As for the story itself, it has (for me) two elements I have enjoyed in my own life (motorcycle riding and waterskiing), so I'm probably being more generous about this movie's appeal then I would be otherwise... but that is why all opinions are biased.Instead of outlining the plot, I will just summarize that visually, this movie is more attractive to the eye than many of Elvis' other movies (that have too many studio sets instead of using outdoor shots). Although most of this film was shot in California than Florida, they pulled it off.Elvis' movies, for the most part were make you feel good movies, so to judge this as anything more than that would be doing Elvis a disservice. This film did mark the beginning of the end for Elvis in a number of ways. It was the last film for which he received a guaranteed million dollar salary. He also began overeating prior to this movie and had to take diet pills to reverse the direction his weight was heading. No more needs to be said.If you are like me and either have only a few Elvis movie DVDs in your collection (I have about 10 of his 31) and are wondering which ones are more enjoyable than others, I can only give you a general guideline and that is that most of his better movies were from the FIRST third of the 31. I don't think you can go wrong at all by picking any of his first five (Love Me Tender, Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, King Creole, and GI Blues) as well as Viva Las Vegas, Blue Hawaii, It Happened At The World's Fair, Roustabout, and Follow That Dream. I think these movies do a better job of showcasing Elvis' untapped acting potential. I wrote untapped because you could see if he was given better scripts (especially after his first five movies), he could have shown so much more of what he had to offer. Thanks a lot Hal Wallis!Overall, I don't recommend this movie for purchase unless you have to have every movie in which Elvis has appeared."
1789,2,Positive,"Being a low price DVD, you do not really expect much, unfortunately though this really goes too far resulting in the VHS version being far better quality. I expect the powers that be thought this film is only aimed at hardcore Elvis fans and corners were cut, this would be the same thought process that managed to produce these calibre of films to start with. I am also surprised that some of the other films in MGM's vaults were not released first, examples being It Happened At The Worlds Fair and Live A little Love A little, especially with the worldwide success of A Little Less Conversation."
1796,1,Positive,I expected more from this movie and more from zac Enron. I would give this movie a D. Try neighbors 2 instead
1804,1,Positive,"The trailers made the movie look like it had potential to be a funny movie...it did have its moments, but that was it, the rest of the movie was not good....not one I would recommend!"
1807,2,Positive,"Typical Zac Efron comedy, Anna Kendrick always good. Wedding dates in Hawii"
1808,2,Positive,"A good fraternity movie without plot, character, and reason but tried to shock."
1809,2,Positive,It looked funny and has its moments but maybe I expected more from the movie but didn't deliver on full humor but raunchy humor.
1810,2,Positive,Thought this movie could be funnier. The previews always show the best parts. And I thought the movie is a let down. They try too hard to be funny........
1814,2,Positive,I heard this movie was amazing i watched it and it sucked
1819,2,Positive,"Movie is ok... Not really good and not really bad.... It lost my attention and a day after I watched it, I can not remember 1 scene from it"
1820,2,Positive,Raunchy comedy. Much of it not all that humorous unless you're a millennial that sees low value cheap shot political correctness as funny.
1822,2,Positive,A few funny parts but overall not a movie I'd watch multiple times. It's a renter.
1824,2,Positive,What to say about this movie. There were some very funny parts. There are some very explicit parts as well. Not likely to watch again. You may want to rent this.
2554,2,Positive,"Progresso had a Meatball and Rice soup last year (2015) that Target carried in the Bay Area and I loved it, kept going back to purchase larger and larger quantities when I ran out. Then the weather got hot and I stopped buying soup. With winter again, I wanted that soup and couldn't find it anywhere. I was so happy when I found that Target.com had it and purchased more than a dozen cans. Much to my surprise, it's not the same recipe! The soup I had last year was tomato based and only had meatballs. This soup is also tomato based, I think. I couldn't quite tell because of how much oregano was in it. And it had chunks of chicken and bits of corn. It tastes so different from the soup from last year! I've decided to donate the rest of my cans to a food bank for the holidays and hope that someone else will like it more than me. Target.com had great prices and the delivery was incredibly fast. The cans of soup were wrapped in heavy duty plastic bags, somewhat wasteful but definitely helpful to prevent spills should any cans unexpectedly get punctured or damaged, although none were damaged. Too bad the plastic bags had some tiny holes in them, otherwise I could have put them to other uses as pet waste pick-up, oh well. So, overall, the soup was a disappointment but the buying experience was good."
2578,2,Positive,DOESN'T REALLY WORK. SUPER MESSY/STICKY.
2583,1,Positive,"My family and I absolutely love the first one. Seen it maybe 8+ times and still cracks me up. That said, after watching the 2nd one, we all thought is was a major let down. The humor was pushed and not natural. Used the grandmother way too much, and each time it wasn't funny, but was ridiculous. And this will be weird saying, but everything was too ""Greek"". Yes, we understand that the family is 100% Greek, but the movie made them out to be absolute idiots (their homes especially). In the last move, Toula ended up being a very strong character, but she is back to being frumpy again at the beginning of the 2nd movie and having to find herself again. The list goes on and on and there are just too many reasons to skip this movie. Go back and watch the first one, laugh and enjoy it, and don't ruin it by witnessing this disappointment."
2592,2,Positive,"Had a lot to live up to, plus it was 14 years after the original. Fiance and I had a little bad taste in our mouths. Laughed only a few times. Probably recommended as a rental, unless you're Greek."
2593,2,Positive,"I did not like this as much as the first one, it was just kind of like a reunion show. It was just ok. I bought the movie for a friend that really liked it."
2594,2,Positive,Not the best sequel but what did you really expect. The original was a breath of fresh air the sequel was trying to get the same breath when we already had the fresh air.
2595,2,Positive,"I thought the movie was entertaining, it still focused on family but it was slow in parts."
2597,2,Positive,"Nothing new, if you are a huge fan of the first you might like this. I felt it a waste of time."
2600,2,Positive,gave it as a gift did not watch the first one do not plan on it
3253,1,Positive,"The heater only stays on for 2-4 minutes max, then it shuts off. The instructions on the sticker says that if it turns off, then unplug it for 30 minutes. So freeze for 30 and warm for 2-4 minutes, not ok. It's winter and my office door has to stay open to a long hallway, so I know it's not turning off because the room warm and cozy."
3254,1,Positive,"When I bought it I thought it was great, but after only a few months it started turning off within minutes of turning on. I checked it over and see no buildup on the coils, have it in an open spot where it gets plenty circulation, but yet it never stays on for more than 3 or 4 minutes."
3255,1,Positive,"Bought this heater tonight, plugged it in for a good 5 minutes and my whole power went out! Shame."
3257,1,Positive,I bought this directly from company since it was out of season at Walgreens. The purpose was to plug it in under my desk at work to stay warm. The thing is so loud I cannot use it in an office enviorment without upsetting my coworkers. It sits inside a drawer in my desk at work. I am too busy to pack the thing up and return it.
3258,1,Positive,"I have this space heater and it is junk! Turns on and heats up and when it gets hot, it turns off and will not turn back on! I have had many heaters and this one is not vry good!"
3260,1,Positive,This product was brand new and literally never worked once.
3261,1,Positive,"This heater mostly blows air. It takes almost an hour before you feel the heat. The plug melted after owning for a month. It would be better for a very very small room , that is the size of a closet. I have to turn my television up to be able to hear over the noise."
3330,1,Positive,"It smells great and I love the texture, however, it leaves my hair uber-oily. I can't deal with it being so stringy after a wash. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
3331,1,Positive,"Well, I definitely did not like the Pro-V AgeDefy conditioner. I was excited to try the pair of shampoo and conditioner together but was not overly impressed with the outcome of my hair. The conditioner not only smells like vitamins (not very appealing) but it left my hair limp and lifeless. I tried the conditioner with other shampoos thinking it might be the shampoo, but unfortunately I got the same results. Won't be purchasing this conditioner in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
3332,1,Positive,"I tried the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner yesterday. While it as in my hair in the shower it felt creamy and smelled great. As it was drying my hair looked a little frizzy but still ok, but throughout the day my head started to have a slight burn and itch (I can still feel it today). It was fine before. And my hair feels drier and more coarse than it did before. My hair now actually feels crunchy. I swear it said conditioner on the bottle. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
3333,1,Positive,"I've been using the Pro-V AgeDefy conditioner for a month now and I've literally noticed no difference in my hair at all. My hair is special it doesn't play nice with ANY shampoo or conditioner. Doesn't matter what the label claims, my hair won't do it. I've given up hope of ever having nice hair without having to beat it into submission. I will say that this conditioner is nice and thick, just the way I like it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
3334,2,Positive,This is a nice basic conditioner. It smells good. It could be more moisturising though. I recently found out Pantene does tests on animals. That is something I avoid whenever I can. I wont be buying. I can easily find the same product without animal testing. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
3335,2,Positive,When I first got this product I thought that the scent was a bit overwhelming but that didn't translate in the shower or on my hair. My hair is very fine and I don't have a lot so I don't use conditioner as the product just weighs my hair down. Testing out this product was the first time I've used conditioner in a LONG time. The product did leave my hair very shiny and smooth....I loved the feel of my hair. Unfortunately I find this product to heavy on my hair as it ended up flat and limp. I gave up using this product after two uses as I didn't like the look of my lifeless hair. I don't think this product is good for people with fine hair like me. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
3336,2,Positive,"As for the conditioner I loved the scent it left on my hair. It felt very silky and soft when my hair was wet. But again, it made my hair way to frizzy like I just came out of a wind storm. As long as my hair was wet I was ok, but as soon as my hair started to dry game over my hair had a mind of it's own. I did have a nice shine in my hair and it did smell good, but otherwise it is a no go for me. But everyone has to try it so they came make their own opinion and decide for themselves. Pantene is a great product and I have used some of their other products before, but this one is just not for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
3337,2,Positive,"I have been using the Age Defy line for about a month now and while I love the smell of the product (and the lather that the shampoo provided) I really cannot give this conditioner a great review. I felt that I really had to use a lot of it on my hair which is highlighted, a bit dry, thin and fine. I ended up finally purchasing a good finishing oil to get a result which I didn't have to do with my previous conditioner. Compared to other Pantene conditioners I have tried, I would give this product a miss. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
3338,2,Positive,"I did notice it made my hair feel much softer and did notice less hair in the sink but I did find it very heavy compared to what I was using and it weighed my hair down. It didn't help with making my hair look full or the frizziness. All in all, it definitely made my hair smoother and more hydrated but it's not something I would purchase This review was collected as part of a promotion."
3339,2,Positive,"So I have to do a second report as a follow up to my first. I have given this product the good old college try but have had to stop using. Although the conditioner makes my hair manageable and soft and the scent is very nice, I experience extreme flyaways after using so much so, that I must go two days (between hair washing) with very little interaction between my hair and a hair brush. I have moved to another conditioner and the fly aways went away. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
3340,2,Positive,"My husband and I use Pantene products regularly. This was our first time however, trying Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. Personally, I was not a fan of this product right from the start. I did not like the scent at all. It has a peculiar medicinal-like smell to it which put me off immediately. Also, I found that these products (both the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner) were too rich for my fine hair oily scalp. My hair was left lifeless, with no volume and unmanageable. I make an effort not to wash my colour-treated hair everyday to maintain the colour longer. This certainly is not possible with Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. By the second day after using the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was greasy, flat and smelled bad. Since this product was not right for me, I decided to pass it on to my husband who reports back to me that he likes Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner and will likely continue buying it. Although this product is not right for me, it did end up being a success for my husband. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
3477,1,Positive,Tasted like warm mayonnaise - contacted MaraNatha to let them know.
3493,1,Positive,I couldn't really detect any kind of brownie or even chocolate flavor. Just cloyingly sweet chemical flavor with the added pleasure of looking like you're wearing powdered sugar lipgloss.
3494,1,Positive,Net wt was literally half of the claimed weight on outside of bag. i could fold the bag completely in half touching top of bag to bottom. There was no hole or opening in bag so they filled it to this level intentionally.
3590,1,Positive,"This product is a complete joke it does not do what I says it does and I have be left with the same old dried up hair look and I can't get a brush through it it certainly does not leave it with a glossy, gleaming finish. Do not buy"
3591,1,Positive,"Bought this conditioner the other day, I usually just get the regular Tresemme conditioner, but I saw this one was a little more expensive, said expert on it and listed other fancy ingredients that I didn't really understand (but who does), and so I figured this was probably a higher quality product. I don't know why, but that was not the case at all for me. Been using it for a few days now, and I'm ready to stop. My hair feels greasy, it's messy, and not at all behaving like it normally does. I honestly used the last remnants of my regular conditioner bottle watered-down so I could get the last bits out of the bottle (we all do that, right) and that worked better than this. Not a fan at all. Very disappointing."
3592,1,Positive,I have biracial curly super dry hair and have relied on this conditioner as my go to for my island lifestyle. I'm usually is salt water or chlorine and am in the shower at least twice a day. I only used the original karatin formula to nourish my locks. Which looked amazing after keratin conditioner and avocado oil as a leave in. The new formula is much lighter. My hair is now moisture starved and won't hold a gold curl. It looks matter down. So sad. Not sure why they changed the formula.
3593,1,Positive,"My hair was wavy/curly and always frizzy due to humidity. I read the bottles for the Keratin Smooth line and was excited to see that it helped battle frizz. I decided to give it a try. I washed my hair with the shampoo and then used the conditioner, and it is now bone straight. I can't even scrunch it. I am soooo truly upset. Will my hair ever curl again I've washed it twice since using the Keratin Smooth stuff. I only used the stuff ONE TIME! And, it did NOT help with my frizz either. Right now, I'm living in a nightmare. I want my curls back!!! I definitely would not recommend this line to anyone."
3595,2,Positive,This shampoo/conditioner is great the first day.....not so great the next day. I have very normal hair and can go a day or two without washing. Not with this product. I'm very disappointed as this was more expensive than the regular product.
3647,1,Positive,I would have loved it if it would have stayed plugged in and on.
3652,1,Positive,"Everything isn't for everyone. Before you use this product, know your hair type as well as the state of your hair. I have transitioning 4b hair and this product caused massive tangles and knots in my hair, so much so that I had to cut them out! As a result, I'm left with uneven hair all over my head. Furthermore it left my natural hair dry and much of my normal wave pattern is gone. I can tell I'm in for a long road in trying to repair the damage its caused."
3653,1,Positive,"I decided to try this conditioner thinking it would rejuvenate my curls but it did the exact opposite. This product made my hair feel like straw! It had that squeaky feeling after, you know the one you get when you use sulfate shampoos... It really didnt do anything. SMH"
3664,1,Positive,"I have been using Arrid for decades...it was the only product that kept me dry. I liked it so much so, that I started ordering it by the case (less expensive that way too). About two months ago, I used the last can from the case. I picked up a can at my local grocery and thought I was good to go. Not so. I was surprised that I felt wetness an hour after I used the new can. I thought it might have been a 'bad' batch that had worked its way to my market. So, I went to a different store and bought another can....same thing happened. Evidently, the formula was changed or something...the last spray from the can from my case worked fine. The new purchases didn't. So, I don't think it's my body chemistry that has changed. I think it is Arrid. I am now searching for a better product or one that works. Too bad, Arrid. You've lost a loyal customer."
3704,1,Positive,I read the ingredients and did not find any ginger ale in the ingredients. Why is this product not been invested for deceptive marketing practices. I will not buy the product any more.
3777,2,Positive,It is too loud. One of them did not work. Otherwise it's good.
3790,1,Positive,Too hard to put items in - kept jamming fingers on the inner file divisions. Maybe good if only going to have a few pieces of info in a file - like a monthly/customer file. Most of my filing involves a lot of papers - this doesn't work for that.
3791,1,Positive,"I purchased this product for my business use. Although the concept was good, the construction was marginal and the quality of the materials was poor. This is unusual for Pendaflex product as they are known for quality products"
3792,2,Positive,Limited uses. Product is not good if using multiple full size sheets of paper. Would be good for receipts and things like that. Good that small things won't fall through the bottom of the folder. Folder sections don't expand with the rest of the file folder for thicker files. The major flaw is how thin the file folder is. I use file folders to protect other papers - I want something that will hold up to a lot of handling and tossing on the car seat or on the desk. I don't want something that looks and feels like paper - I want something stronger.
3795,2,Positive,The only thing I would change about this product would be to have made it available in a variety of colors.
3797,2,Positive,"Great idea, but this product needs to be sturdier to stand up to the repeated use I give my folders. The paper is too flimsy. I would definitely use it if the paper quality was upgraded."
3798,2,Positive,"If paper used was heavier, it would be a great item. However current paper is not heavy enough...if used constantly, not sure how long it would last."
3799,2,Positive,"I use this product to organize my business files. I like that I am able to separate my documents in sections. However, it is limited. It would be practical is the left side opened instead. The product is flimsy and does not seem as durable as I expected."
3801,2,Positive,I use it to organize high level visits to my building with many lists and subsections needed. Unfortunately it does not hold up well. Could be made of a stronger (thicker) stock.
4107,1,Positive,I'm so sorry to write something negative about such a good company but this detergent didn't work for our family of 6. There is no scent at all so sometimes the sort of stinky stuff still has a slight ordor. Stains don't come out at all. It is very gentle for our little boy who has very sensitive skin so that part is good! But we will not be buying this again.
4132,1,Positive,Works great until it breaks I've had two and they both did the same exact thing they both power off and need parts that can never be replaced apparently great vacuum too bad it Will never turn on again and is total garbage
4134,1,Positive,One of the best vacuums I have ever owned until the handle snapped right off--bought in 2012. Had to finish vacuuming so I did until it died completely. Really bummed! Thankfully it's still under warranty so will be taking it in where I hope they can fix it. I just hope it doesn't take too long!
4135,1,Positive,"I loved my Hoover Platinum vacuum, but after just one year the handle just broke right in half today while I was in the middle of vacuuming my carpet. I can't say this has ever happened to me with any other vacuum I have ever bought. I don't think a 300 vacuum should be made in such an inferior way."
4136,1,Positive,"Upright is worthless. Spits out dirt, cant get into tight places, loud and bulky. I would never buy another one of these again. Only good thing is the nice long cord. The additional canister vac works better than the upright but the attachment tube to use the floor head broke, rendering it useless. Same your money!"
4138,1,Positive,"The Upright Vacuum out of the box is stuck on low. The hepa filter bags probably work ok but dust is shooting out the tubes in the back which basically negates any respiratory advantages using a hepa filter. I all fairness, I like the way it vacuums (I am in a power wheel chair), however, for the above reasons I will be returning it."
4139,1,Positive,Spent alot of time researching this product and when I purchased and got it home it never ran properly. Each time I would start it up and started to vaccum my carpet it woudl shut down. What a disappointment!! Returned it and went and bought a Dyson for 100.00 more and I LOVE IT!!
4140,1,Positive,"I read Consumers Reports and usually agree with their recommendations. This vacuum was highly recommended so we bought one. It was very lightweight (which was good), it had decent suction (which was OK), but it had a problem switching from High to Low via the switch mounted on the handle just below the power button. No problem, returned it and got another one -- same issue. Just like the first unit, the switch was intermittent -- sometimes it worked, mostly it didn't. Hoover has an obvious design issue here. We ended up with a Dyson - significantly more but what a machine..."
4141,1,Positive,"Originally I reviewed this Hoover Vacuum in 11/2010 (on Walmart website) after I first purchased it at that time I gave it 5 stars there since then my user opinion has *changed*.. In October 2012 the ergonomic handle had to be replaced since it was coming apart which I guess stemmed from the oils in my hand when using the vacuum (design flaw).. The vacuum was under 60 month warranty so Hoover directed me to a local vacuum dealer they recommended here in Florida (second mistake) it was replaced.. While I only vacuum weekly I started to notice a lack of suction power for this vacuum which was disappointing me big time, but not wanting to spend money again I continued on with it.. I clean the wheels, brushes rollers frequently change the bag often whether it needs it or not so not sure what the problem is with this vacuum.. I originally purchased this vacuum to replace my Sears canister vacuum for poor performance, but now I am about to throw in the towel on this one too since its not worth the aggravation would like a vacuum with more suction power to keep my carpets fresh I actually hate to vacuum now because of this issue with this Hoover vacuum.. Hope others that have purchased this vacuum have better luck with it.."
4142,1,Positive,"The upright does (did) a wonderful job until today when I was body slammed by the same peril that did in my last vacuum, plastic parts. Apparently the engineers who constructed this model were in a hurry because they did not adequately assess the forces where the power/control handle meets the shaft. Today mine snapped off at that point without warning. I got this model in Novemeber 2010 because it had top ranking with Consumer Reports. Likewise my prior vac, Kenmore canister, carried a top ranking and plastic fatigue failure in the handle assembly was the culprit there too. Even though I am a guy I am not rough with these units. What I don't understand is the failure to use metal at key stress points so that this does not happen. I'd willingly pay more money for a product that endures."
4143,1,Positive,"Loved this machine until I replaced my worn out carpet with a low freize. It will not roll over it at all, let Hoover know of the problem and they said it is not designed for high pile carpet or plush padding underneath carpet. They said to return it and by a Hoover with a manual adjusting carpet height button. Well Hoover I've had this for over a year, so I'm out of luck on the return. If I do get a new vacuum it won't be a Hoover because you certainly don't stand behind your product......boasting of an automatic heighth adjuster on this vacuum that really doesn't work.....shame on you for taking my hard earned money!!! I notice that this machine is not for sale anymore in stores...wonder why Please don't buy this machine if you ever plan to put in nice carpet!"
4145,1,Positive,I bought this product in January 2012 and now the handle broke at the top assembly. I would expect a vacuum cleaner to last longer than this. I see from other reviews that I am not the only one with this problem.
4147,1,Positive,"I bought this vacuum on September 8th 2009. Two days before Christmas it just started to shut off. I couldn't get a hold of anyone until the 28th to find where to take it for repair.When I finally got it in on the 28th the repair guy laughed and said it was just their cheap machine with a longer warranty. And advised me to purchase a different vacuum because it would take forever to get the parts. Well, it's January 22nd and still the parts have not come in. Turns out they close for weeks after Christmas and do not reopen until January 11th! So I am SOL and should just buy a new one because they can't do anything for me.The vacuum did pick up well, but I could have done better and gotten away cheaper by going to a store that specializes in vacuums. They would of been able to tell me to stay away."
4148,1,Positive,"I purchased this and loved it at first as it was so light weight. However I got new carpet that was a bit taller and now I cannot move it across the floor. The self adjusting height is nonexistent. When I wrote to Hoover, they just said I must have purchased the wrong vacuum for the carpet. There is no information regarding carpet type in the promotional materials. Don't buy this product."
4149,1,Positive,"Right out the box...I assembled the vacuum and was excited. I started using the canister and loved it. I would have loved a bag to keep everything together, but I accepted because I loved it. THEN...I used the upright. Still in one room, the sensor light comes on after 5mins of use! Since then the Hoover helpdesk ONLY tells me to send it to a Hoover site for maintenance or Return it to the store. O**ck it is! My sister raved about it and never reported sensor problems."
4150,1,Positive,"Impossible to push on freize carpet with moderatly high pile. Head does not adjust to accomodate higher pile carpet. Works great with plush low plie. Contacted Hoover and they said tough luck. I have to give it away, and get another vacuum that will work on freize carpet."
4151,1,Positive,"Loved this machine until I replaced my worn out carpet with a low freize. It will not roll over it at all, let Hoover know of the problem and they said it is not designed for high pile carpet or plush padding underneath carpet. They said to return it and by a Hoover with a manual adjusting carpet height button. Well Hoover I've had this for over a year, so I'm out of luck on the return. If I do get a new vacuum it won't be a Hoover because you certainly don't stand behind your product......boasting of an automatic heighth adjuster on this vacuum that really doesn't work.....shame on you for taking my hard earned money!!! I notice that this machine is not for sale anymore in stores...wonder why Please don't buy this machine if you ever plan to put in nice carpet!"
4153,2,Positive,"I bought this vaccum on 5-1-11, it worked fine for 14 months and the handle just snapped in half while I was sweeping one day. It was replaced on 8-1-12 after not being able to be repaired. The same exact thing happened last week again, handle broke! It was only 10 months old!"
4156,2,Positive,"We have owned this vacuum for over a year now. Worked great until we replaced a large room with thick pile, high quality carpet. The auto height adjustment feature does not work properly and continually shuts off the vacuum. In our opinion this is a major flaw and can not recommend this Hoover model."
4157,2,Positive,Liked the large bag - hate bagless vacuums because of the mess. But the handle broke just above the bag and it was 200 for the replacement part. That is pretty much the cost of a new one so no value to that. Went with a cheap bagless figured I would just throw it away if a part broke.
4159,2,Positive,"I had the same experience as GAK2010. The vacuum power light would flash, then the vacuum would turn off. The check bag light never went on, but I discovered the bag was 3/4 full. I changed the bag and also pulled a thread and some dust clogs from the brush. It than ran for about 20 minutes then repeated the problem. I took it to a vacuum repair shop and he cleaned it out thoroughly. 42 later, it continued to shut off. I did not take it t the authorized dealer because he has a terrible reputation, and does not even sell Hoovers. I called Hoover and they suggested I clean the filter under the bag. Didn't solve the problem!"
4160,2,Positive,"I thought I was getting a good vacuum based on reviews I read and b/c I had a Hoover previously that lasted 15+ years, but I'm extremely disappointed. I am having to take this vacuum into the repair shop for the second time in 2 years! The first was because the power kept shutting off by itself and now because the entire handle broke off (and I am just doing regular vacuuming on regular carpet). Sure, there is a 5 year warranty, but the service centers are not convenient in any way. Other things I dislike about the vacuum is that it does not adjust to carpet height, and the power button is located in the worst place. Also, the canister is very loud and the hose continually comes out as I'm vacuuming b/c it doesn't have good latch to keep it attached."
4161,2,Positive,Was very dissappointed. Worked ok on regular carpeting but the sensor that supposedly adjusts from one floor surface to another simply does not work. Looks nice...would have enjoyed the cannister vacuum... but returned it for a less expensive Hoover Windtunnel that works much much better for our needs.
4162,2,Positive,"I purchased my Hoover Platinum in Nov 2010 to replace another well known vacuum that I had. I specifically selected Hoover because I had Hoover vac's in the past Hoover has a good reliable name. I love the vacuum however, I don't like having to use a separate vac for tools that's bothersome to me. I've just recently replaced the belt brushroller (easy to do) which I felt was about right for 2 yrs of once a week vacuuming. HOWEVER, I was shocked yesterday when I noticed that the inside of the ergonomic handle was peeling away that was very unexpected for a Hoover product in this price point. Sadly this issue with the handle peeling away bothers me since it now means that this vacuum is not really a Platinum but more like Stainless Steel has reached the end of its life span after 2 years."
4163,2,Positive,"Nice vacuum cleaner, if you DON'T have thick pile carpeting. Beater bar does not automatically adjust as stated. Vacuum shuts down automatically on thick pile, high quality carpet. I don't recommend. This is major flaw. My opinion, purchase a vacuum where you can individually adjust the height of the beater bar."
4164,2,Positive,"I the Hoover Platinum Collection and was very happy with it. Then one day the on/off switch started blinking and it has not worked since. The motor will run if you hold it at a 45 degree angle but if you try to run it like a regular sweeper it stops running. For the price it should run better. Unfortunately I do not have my receipt, I have the owners manual, but no receipt. Interestingly enough I had an old Hoover Elite Supreme in the basement and that is what I have been using, it still runs:("
4165,2,Positive,"We have owned this vacuum cleaner for several years and can say it's wonderful except for one thing.It cleans well, uses bags (why would someone not?) and is very lightweight.The handle has broken off twice, The second time after paying a vacuum repair shop to fix it. Otherwise a 5 star."
4166,2,Positive,"I tested four vacuum cleaners. The Dyson DC 41, this vacuum, the shark navigator lift away, and the shark rotator professional. There is not much to say about what I liked about this vacuum. The edge cleaning that it boasts is laughable at best, and the boast about direct air cleaning, also leaves much to be desired, though it did vacuum acceptably. The canister vacuum is virtually useless. It could not even pick up the loose hair from tile floor without me running over it multiple times with that brush attachment. For the price, I definitely expected more, and was sadly disappointed by that name, considering I came from an older Hoover that did its job very well. I settled on the shark rotator pro for it's versatility, price, weight, and vacuuming power."
4167,2,Positive,"Being a Hoover Platinum Collection unit, I really expected better performance based on my perceived reputation of Hoover vacuums. Below average suction on floor unit; no on-board tools. Must use second portable unit in package that has hand tools. Bag indicator light on handle of floor unit keeps lighting up as ""check bag"". Checked bag and it was not full and was installed correctly. I plan on returning."
4518,1,Positive,"This was the WORST pizza I've ever had in my life. The crust was gross. The sauce was delicious but there wasn't much of it. There also wasn't enough cheese. Bottom line, don't buy it. Try a different gluten free pizza. Amy's Drive Thru has some great ones."
4532,1,Positive,I enjoyed the movies and the video games. I read the reviews and decided to buy the set for the digital copies of all the movies. I was upset it was only a copy of the last movie only. Total waste of money. I want to return the set for that reason.
4534,1,Positive,The movies just suck. The first movie is okay but gets worse with each sequel.
4535,1,Positive,Great movies all in one video box and also at a fantastic price.
4537,2,Positive,Misleading. The digital that download is only good for one movie in the series.
4538,2,Positive,"This series is one of those where you can sit down and watch the whole thing on a lazy day to keep yourself mildly entertained. There are some cool moments throughout the various films, but nothing spectacular about any of them. A guilty pleasure for sure."
4539,2,Positive,Great deal for pretty average movies but Blu-rays look pretty good and I only paid five dollars for five blu rays.
4540,2,Positive,"If you are a fan of the Resident Evil series then this box set gives you the first 5 with the nice outer box sleeve. In terms of physical product style, it's cool, basic, but cool. The movies are fairly lackluster in my opinion with the first one being a flawed ""okay,"" and then the second and third one being more B movie fun, before the series becomes unwatchable with the fourth and fifth film."
5413,2,Positive,The show is unique. I'll give it that. But just not the Sci-Fi show for me.
5591,2,Positive,"Overall a cute tongue in cheek comedy, with some decent cinematography at points but alas, it's like they took Expendables and actually tried too hard to not make it another Expendables.. Worth a rent on the dollar list."
5592,2,Positive,"Bought this because it was on sale because I enjoy most of the cast. Wasn't what I had expected, but not bad."
5593,2,Positive,its a ok movie but it was a gift for somebody so I just bought it
6263,1,Positive,"I could drink this with a straw. Nasty, full of water. What happened to your good chili"
6265,1,Positive,I can not eat anything with Monosodium glutamate in it. I would love to eat your chili but until it is MSG free I can not
6266,1,Positive,I used to buy Hormel chili all the time because it did not have pork in it. Now I will not be buying it. I was very surprised to see this. Why did you have to add pork
6268,1,Positive,"This recipe for your chill is horrible. You need to revert back to the recipe you used twenty years ago, then it taste great. I will not be buying your chill until a new and improved recipe comes out. And it better be good."
6270,1,Positive,"Purchased this chili for years. It was the best. Would buy by the case and eat once or twice a week. About a year or so ago Something changed. Now I have a lot of cans that I will not eat and really would not even give away, it's that bad. It sits on the shell and finally I have resolved to just toss it out."
6271,1,Positive,"Same as Wolf brand that is why we quit Wolf brand and now they are the same. Watery, no meat and yuk!!!! We will never buy again. We will just make our own"
6273,1,Positive,"Use to be years ago this is the only kind of chili my grandparents had in our house, but I will not be buying it anymore since I now know that it has pork in it. I do not eat pork, so surely do not want it in my chili"
6275,2,Positive,"Hormel added pork to their no beans chili, since I cannot eat pork I can no longer enjoy my previously favored brand. On top of it there were no warning on the label indicating that they had a major recipe change and I can no longer trust this brand. I would love to be able to eat their product, previously it had been my go-to and always in my pantry."
6278,2,Positive,"This tastes like canned hot dog sauce more than chili. It might be okay on a hot dog with onions, but not for a bowl of chili. I won't buy it again."
6459,1,Positive,This meal was extremely sweet and had a very strong pepper flavor. I could not eat it.
6479,1,Positive,"This is an outstanding product, it not only cleans surfaces, but it has such a clean and fresh smell..I use it all the time."
6480,1,Positive,"I have been an avid user of Clorox Wipes for many years and loved them. Something has been changed about them recently and my last 3 purchases have all exhibited this change - the SMELL. It is awful. They all smell the same. I don't know if people on the west coast are familiar with stink bugs but here on the east coast, there is an infestation. That's exactly how the Clorox wipes smell now. Please change back to the old formula QUICK!!!!!!"
6481,1,Positive,"I have used Clorox Wipes for years... Cannot live without them (or prefer not to). Now the smell is so irritating, I will have to purchase another brand to continue my Spring cleaning. I've never had such a strong objection to the smell of any cleaning product. Please at least offer a choice in the old vs. new formula."
6482,1,Positive,"I use Clorox wipes fanatically all over my home and I have done so for years - I have always loved them...until now! I just got the wipes with grease fighting power and it smells HORRIBLE. The main reason I use these wipes is because they make stuff smell fresh and clean. I am sad to say, I may be looking for a new product. Maybe Clorox can offer 2 different kinds I don't really have grease in my bathroom, or on my main kitchen counter spaces, usually grease is only on my stove..."
6483,1,Positive,"Being a mom of three, disinfecting the home has always been a big priority to keep my family healthy and germs at a minimum. I always turn to Clorox to make that happen. I have been using these products for many years and will continue to do so. Thanks for all of the great products that you offer. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
6484,1,Positive,"LOVE Clorox wipes, but this batch is horrible. The wipes have separated and won't come out of canister in one piece. They rip and tear apart which then makes using 1 wipe useless. You have to get several out just to clean something. The smell is great tho."
6485,1,Positive,"I normally buy Clorox brand disinfecting wipes over generic wipes because I like the Fresh Scent. I notice that you've changed the scent and strongly dislike it. While I'll look for Lavender scent in the future, I suspect it does not have wide distribution."
6487,1,Positive,"I would give ZERO stars to the New Formula Clorox Wipes. I agree with all the other users that say the new formula smells awful. It may cut grease now but I liked the old streak free formula a lot better and it smelled nice. Whatever is in the new formula that cuts grease also makes my hands burn. I've switched to my store brand now since they work just as well as the new formula and they smell better. And they don't make my hands burn when I use them! And they don't leave streaks all over my bathroom counters, mirrors and stove like the Clorox wipes do now. Everyone (including me) used to love Clorox wipes when they first came out. Learn a lesson Clorox- if it isn't broke, don't try to fix it!"
6489,1,Positive,I have used Clorox wipes for a number of years and was excited to try the new products. While I really like the new dispensing top the new scent is unpleasant and I wouldn't call it lemon. I also didn't think that the quality of cleaning was as good as the old product. While the new wipe is textured on one side and soft on the other I felt like I had to scrub much harder and the surface didn't get as clean. I will not buy this product again.
6490,1,Positive,"I was expecting these wipes to have a strong clorox smell but they don't, they actually have a refreshing fragrance. I use them regularly and feel confident that I'm eliminating germs from every surface on which I use them."
6492,1,Positive,"Clorox wipes are a great product for disinfecting surfaces that harbor germs. Great for cleaning kitchen counters, door handles and in general. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
6493,1,Positive,love to use the wipes when cleaning the bathroom. you gotta love boys!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
6494,1,Positive,I don't like the smell of most strong cleaners. And the earthy cleaners aren't always enough. The green top clorox wipes are my go to disinfectant wipes when we are sick! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
6497,2,Positive,Love the product. A great value and I know my family is germ free. Will recommend to friends and family. Thanks Clorox for being 1 This review was collected as part of a promotion.
6498,2,Positive,great product I use it all the time. I like the lemon scent the best. it really cleans my kitchen good This review was collected as part of a promotion.
6499,2,Positive,i like the wipes cause they are easy to use and handy to keep in all the roooms in the houw This review was collected as part of a promotion.
6500,2,Positive,"it would really be nice if the wipe would PICK UP the hair and dust that accumulates in bathroom rather than just moving it around and leaving it in a pile on the surface you're working on. You have lots of smart people working for you, it seems that you would have already figured this out. thanks HO Cody WY"
6501,2,Positive,"i love them, their cheap and desinfected really well especialy if you have kids so handdy This review was collected as part of a promotion."
6502,2,Positive,"Although I like the convenience of a wipe, there are a couple of things I do not like about this product. The scent does not appeal to me. Also, the dispenser is frustrating to use. Sometimes many wipes come out, sometimes it takes several minutes to get one out."
6504,2,Positive,Love the product. A great value and I know my family is germ free. Will recommend to friends and family. Thanks Clorox for being 1 This review was collected as part of a promotion.
6505,2,Positive,"The new formula leaves streaks on my glass and mirrors, that was the one reason I used your brand instead of other cheaper brands."
15337,2,Positive,"Keebler Chips Deluxe Soft 'N Chewy Cookies are soft and chewy, but they lack flavor. We bought 2 packages of these and thought that maybe it was just that package that was bad, but both packages were flavorless. Just wasn't what we were expecting from Keebler."
15352,1,Positive,I got this for a wisdom tooth I had to wait until after my daughter was born to have removed. Only worked.for 15 mins before it wore off. Deff not liking this product. Those 15 mins are pain free but it dont last long enough to help
15353,1,Positive,"I bought this and and was not at all satisfied with it. The oragel instant gel that came in the blue box, blows this away. It was a blue colored gel. If this is the best oragel has for a really bad toothache, they definitely have lost me as a customer. I have always used oragel, but, I won't ever purchase this again. Simply put it just doesn't do the job."
15398,1,Positive,"Decided to try these based on the good ratings -- they are very overrated, lack taste, seem to be little but puffy flavored air.. not even that cheesy, and certainly no corn -- it's an odd texture as well, not like any other food items.. stick to better munchies, there are many.."
15575,1,Positive,I bought this because I thought it was better than the old fashion way but the mice are still out running around. The green stuff was gone but not one dead mouse.
15576,1,Positive,product not as good as the loose pellets The new product sucks
15577,1,Positive,"DO NOT PURCHASE!!! The move was able to eat the gel and not one mouse died or got poisioned. This product doesn't work!!!! They need to take it off the market. The mice in our apartment was having a field day, enjoying eating the gel position and not dying. Jokes on us!!!! I need a refund !!!"
15582,1,Positive,"Absolutely, nothing like old smell of REAL Lysol. Believe me I know... I'm 80 yrs. old and my mother used it constantly - people come into our house and ask what is is smell and when I went to their houses there it was again the Real True Smell of the OLD Lysol not this fake stuff they sell now a days. Not buying this fake stuff again."
15583,2,Positive,Very oily. Doesn't smell clean.
15584,2,Positive,"Sorry, this product was just not for me. I bought it out of desparation when Lysol stopped adding disinfectant to the all purpose cleaner (which they have since started adding again). Yes, this product did disinfect, but the smell was way, way too pungent for me. I used it to wash down the bathroom floors, the outside of the commode. Days later, the smell still lingered (which would have been nice if it smelled nice). My scrub bucket, sponge, gloves were kept in my cleaning closet and I had to end up throwing the gloves and sponge out. Within minutes it just reaked up the whole closet. Trust me, stick with the all purpose cleaner now known as clean and fresh. It does disinfect and smells nice, which to me is important. No brainer. I'd much rather the house smell of lemons or waterfalls rather than a nursing home."
15587,2,Positive,PLEASE...Bring blue back...It is the best smelling...Anything else is terrible...PLEASE...Bring blue back.
15740,1,Positive,"I LOVE this product but, sadly can't buy it anymore because you've discontinued my favorite colors--papaya and cocoa. Darn!"
15741,1,Positive,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE bring back cocoa! I've wasted 50.00 or more trying these other colors. They don't work for me."
15743,1,Positive,This is by far the best shade out of all of them! We want it back Please please restock!! I gave them all to my friends once upon a time and they all have it.
15744,1,Positive,"I tried this for the first time, and loved the look, but after a half hour or so, my lip started to swell.. it wasn't pleasant. my roommate had the same experience."
15747,1,Positive,Until you bring back Cocoa.. You are minus a customer. This was my all time favorite shade and I haven't found another like it. I am not the only one. Read ALL the reviews....Why take away a good product that people love
15748,1,Positive,"As so many other reviewers have said, Cocoa was a really nice lip color, and now you've discontinued it. I'm so disappointed. Your other colors aren't right for me, so now I'm an ex-customer. I hope you'll reconsider your decision and bring back Cocoa."
15750,1,Positive,As per many of the other reviews -- PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA. I've used this shade for over 7 years -- I have never had a lipstick that works as well as COCOA. It's the best!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring it back. I've tried other Burt's Bees shades -- but nothing looks as good as COCOA. 1 Star -- only because there is no COCOA.
15752,1,Positive,"The Rhubarb lip shimmer was my favorite and I used to be able to wear it with everything. This summer I went to buy more of it and noticed that the color of the cap was different than the one I was using. I bought it and brought it home, and the shade is definitely not the same - it is darker and more pink. It feels a little more waxy also. I am so disappointed! I am wondering why you would change the color and/or formula if this is your best seller"
15754,1,Positive,"I have almost every Burts Bees color of lip shimmer, and I'm only luke warm happy with a couple of them of them. Many of them I hate (and give away to a friend). But COCOA is my favorite lip color of all time--across every brand of lip stick. And Burts Bees has discontinued it the new colors to replace it are completely awful looking on me and now I'm completely out of cocoa lip shimmer. If you don't bring back cocoa lip shimmer soon, you've completely and forever lost a customer. Promise."
15755,1,Positive,"Usually, I pass on registering on sites, but if it will help bring back Cocoa Lip Shimmer, it will have been time well spent. It was my go-to lip product for years and I'm sparingly using the last of it. The same applies to a friend of mine. Both of us are dismayed and none of the other colors is just right. I selected 1 star to reflect my disappointment, but it would have been a 5 if the perfect color for me, and obviously others, hadn't been eliminated. Please bring Cocoa back!"
15756,1,Positive,"I have been purchasing the cocoa lip shimmer for as long as I can remember. I regularly have 5 or more of these floating around purses, make up bags, my desk at work, my car, everywhere. I was so upset to hear that this color has been discontinued. I know several girls at the office use this product too and we joke about how much we Rely on it. Please bring back cocoa. I attempted the plum tonight and hate it . . . fig isn't good either. I am very disappointed in ending a product that was loved by so many."
15758,1,Positive,"I recently bought two tubes of lip shimmer. I LOVE the lip shimmer I had in the past. HOWEVER, the new formulation is NOT GOOD!! I applied the lip shimmer and realized that it was totally rancid. I looked at the ingredients and see that they've changed the formulation to include soy oil and canola oil....both of these oils go rancid VERY quickly and actually promote free radical damage because they are unstable oils. I am returning the two tubes immediately. Burts Bees.....PLEASE return to the previous formula. Rancid oils are no good!!"
15760,1,Positive,"The Lip Shimmers line is great. I have particularly been a fan of the Papaya color ever since I first saw it years ago. It is (was) a great color with bronze/brown tones that worked well for my tones. I got compliments all the time. Apparently Burt's Bees has elected to revamp these colors for no apparent reason, and all of these new colors are very pink toned. You will notice that all of the many, many complaints are from people who preferred bronze or brown tones who have been left behind by this change. I am at a loss to explain why this company would ignore such brand loyalty by changing these colors for essentially no reason, and while providing no acceptable substitute. Please reconsider this decision to provide only pink-toned Lip Shimmers, and bring back the bronze-toned ones, especially wonderful Papaya!"
15761,1,Positive,"I am only giving one star, because of my wasted time. I bought the first tube at a drug store. Love the color on me (Plum). The next day, I rolled it up a little for more coverage and it would not roll back down. Went back to the drug store and returned it for a new tube. Tried it in the store and it rolled up a little and it rolled down. I left the store, got in my car, while driving, I went to apply...rolled it up, applied, then it would not roll down. So I made a u turn and went back to the store. This happened on 4 trips. DANG, FIX THE TUBES."
15762,1,Positive,"I am sure if you advertised the return of Cocoa and set a release date, you would sell out that day! Can you imagine the publicity you could generate from the whole Cocoa following! All of the ad possibilities... Commercials with real women scrambling to buy it out... If the company has no plans to bring back Cocoa at this time, then maybe they should fire the marketing department and hire me. The new shades do not compare to the old ones as evidenced by your own customer forum. I would not recommend the new shades to anyone. They don't even compare to the old ones."
15763,2,Positive,Bring back the old rhubarb - the new tone is too red.
15765,2,Positive,It was too shimmery and made me feel like I was wearing a child's chapstick. The color was fine but if the sparkle was toned down I would have no problems with it.
15766,2,Positive,"my husband bought one for me because he know how much i love those products. Well i hate it !! it makes my lips totally dry, and the color is way too intense, for sure it stayed too long..."
15767,2,Positive,"Love the Lip Shimmer feel, but the color I bought (Grapefruit) didn't give me the light pink color I was after. Instead, my lips looked white and pasty. Had to throw it out."
15768,2,Positive,"I have used the cocoa lip shimmer for years and I love it, but it has been discontinued. I have tried several of the new colors but have wasted my money as none of these compare to the Cocoa. I know that Cocoa was a popular color because it was always out of stock. Hoping that Burt's Bee will bring back Cocoa soon!!!"
15769,2,Positive,"I bought this product thinking I would love it because I love the clear regular burts bees, but this berry color easily comes off when you drink anything and if you accidentally get it on your skin around your lips good luck getting it off...it just makes your skin look irritated and red. Not my favorite unfortunately."
15770,2,Positive,"As a faithful user (and recommender) of the nutmeg lip shimmer for several years, I was pretty upset to find that my recent replacement was now sticky, with weak color, no feeling of peppermint, and didn't last. Did the recipe change (The label is the same.) Please say I can get the original quality back somehow."
15772,2,Positive,"My lips tend to get dry easily and this product didn't effectively hydrate them. In fact, it highlighted the dry ridges on my lips in quite an unflattering way. It was fine appearance-wise if I had just exfoliated my lips, but dreadful otherwise. I ended up having to buy a different product. It's probably good for those with normal lips."
15773,2,Positive,"This was a great product, but now the colors my friends and I have used in the past are no longer available.We wasted a lot of time walking the aisles of many, many stores searching for our colors. Why do you do this We have tried several of your other colors and do not like them. I'm giving two stars because of your color choices. Please return to the colors such as Nutmeg and Toffee. My friends and I are currently using other products, but would return to Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer if you added the old colors back to your collection."
15774,2,Positive,"I used to be a big fan of Burts Bees, but have recently scrutinized the ingredients of every product I use.I am an avid make up fan with a medical and scientific research background. The ingredient carmine is actually acquired from killing a certain type of beetle. It is a pinkish/red dye which comes from this bug and we put it all over our face. Some people don't really care but I think it's a little icky. Carmine is also has other names, can't recall exactly, like Red 4 and some others. This information is easy to find. I think it's interesting that all of the fruit oils are given their pleasant names however carmine does not say beetle dye in parentheses next to the ingredient name. When I wore this lip shimmer prior to gaining this knowledge, I did enjoy the colors and the conditioning properties. Burt's Bees is a good company, but not as perfect as everyone believes. Better than many others. I have stopped using this product and the many others containing carmine from all brands, including Dior, MAC, Benefit, and countless others.Though it appears that the color radiance is lacking the beetle dye."
15775,2,Positive,"when I was a kid, I used to make lip color by grinding up blush and mixing it with lip balm. burt's lip shimmer reminds me of that. there is too much pigment and it sits on top of the lips. not very sheer. so the first application looks ok but if you want to re-apply it builds up and looks thick and uneven. merlot would have been the perfect color, but it was too pigment heavy -- you have to look in the mirror when you apply it. if they eased up on the pigment a little, it would be great. I prefer balms that look like a transparent berry stain, and this is not it. it's more like a dark lipstick. unfortunately, their ligher colors are no better. they're lighter, but they're still not sheer."
16625,2,Positive,"I received this for free in exchange for an honest review. Initially this scent booster smells great and quite strong. I used more than recommended because I have a house full of active boys. Unfortunately, the smell did not last long and was not very strong after the wash. Also, the smell is quite pleasant from the bottle, but there is a lingering odor in my laundry room that is not so great. The lingering smell is a bit too `natural` for my liking; Somewhat like an outdoor odor, which is what I am trying to get rid of."
16655,1,Positive,The juicer seemed ok and was quiet. After a few days I noticed it was leaking juice that should have be going into the juice reservoir was instead going into the waste basket. The pulp was WET and I noticed I was wasting money having to use more fruits/veg to get some juice out.. I returned and got a new breville which spits out almost dry pulp much better than this cuisinart.
16656,2,Positive,I preferred to have a juicer that uses ALL of the fruits and veggies and not throw away all of the good healthy stuff. This just extracts the juice and the pulp goes in the trash..
16657,2,Positive,The unit functions as advertised except for the gap between the feeder tube and the blade basket that allows large chunks of material to be tossed into the pulp jug without processing.
16658,2,Positive,"I believe that this wastes a lot of fruit juice because the pulp is very wet. It takes a great deal of fruit just to product one container of juice (as in the picture). For example, it took 2.5 lbs of kiwi and 2 large apples to product a container of juice. The product is very well made but perhaps juicing isn't in our budget. I am returning this product."
16758,1,Positive,"I have been a faithful and ecstatic fan of Iman for her line of makeup and curtains, however this product was a great disappointment. : ( It was disappointing because it is so easy to carry around its virtually invisible, its the size of a lipstick and its at a great economical price but its so hard to apply, its hard to smooth on evenly over your face and it does not come with an applicator. I guess this product was named Iman clay makeup because it literally feels like you are smoothing clay onto your face and that isn't something I was looking forward to."
16759,2,Positive,"I was excited to try this foundation considering the good reviews and Iman has several different shades to choose from for women of color. I really wanted to like this product but I didnt for many reasons. First of all I bought this one shade too light in Clay 5 and I found out that my shade is an Earth 1. Secondly, it broke me out. I do not think this kind of foundation is meant for somebody with Oily skin such as myself, but I tried Iman's semi loose powder for my other foundations and I have to say that I love it! the powder is great for oil control and it goes on smooth. If you are somebody with normal/Dry skin, then I would recommend this product for you."
16778,1,Positive,"A waste of my money I don't know what kind of black rice this supposed to be,,,it loses most of its color during the cooking process I think it's dyed plus the grains are really short every black rice I've ever had where long grain and did not lose all that coloring doing the cooking process... Just Saying"
16779,1,Positive,"The closed packages arrived today with weevils inside. Yuck! I'm sure this is a wonderful product when it is not contaminated with pests like these, but we just can't stomach them."
16781,1,Positive,Not one person in the family liked the taste.
16782,1,Positive,It's okay but still haven't used all that was originally purchased. Would not order again.
16784,1,Positive,"Yes, I should have read the whole description, so I take part of the blame. However, I can't see how in any way how this rice could be considered RED as stated in the title above:A Gourmet Aromatic Whole Grain RED RiceNowhere on the front of the bag does it clarify that it's brown rice as it does on the back.I'm not saying it's bad rice, just that it's not RED as the title clearly states.There is a specific type of rice known as red rice. This is NOT it. When it arrived in the mail, the front label says RED RICE on the back it says it's brown rice.So, yes, I should have read the whole description closer, but just calling brown rice red on the label doesn't make it so.Disappointed, will not be buying any more Lundberg products. Sorry, but you ticked me off with your misleading labeling."
16786,2,Positive,Don't like wild rice I guess.
17189,1,Positive,This album is definitely not worth the money due to its flimsy design and cheap materials being used.
17200,2,Positive,The smell is very strong and overpowering.
17287,1,Positive,i do turn dial Slowly--but too much makeup comes out...so i wind up using tissue to absorb most of the product before using brush on my face. i think a much smaller hole for liquid to come through brush would be much better
17288,1,Positive,This product leaves an oily/shine feel on my face. I had to blot the oil off but still had a shine. The brissels on the bruch fell out and I cldn't finish using the product. I would not buy this product again. Not for comination skin. Very dissappointed.
17290,2,Positive,"I was looking for a product with more coverage and liked the idea of the brush and the SPF. This product delivered more coverage but the color is just off. I can't figure out if it is too yellow or orange but I am just not happy with it. It did go on nicely and felt good on my skin. I may try another shade but due to the price, I am not sure. It is cheaper than department store foundation but not whenyou end up throwing it away and having to buy another product. I just wasn't happy with it."
17291,2,Positive,"I recently bought the visible lift foundation with the twist brush on top. Foundation is awesome, perfect for my skin tone,,,,,however the pump stopped working after 4 days. I won't be purchasing this again, or recommending it to my friends."
17310,1,Positive,I received this product for free to try in exchange for my honest feedback. I really didn't like having my hair dyed... I don't know how women do it. It burned my scalp and my eyes and I ended up washing it out before it was finished. I will say though my friends noticed I did have less gray even though I washed it out too soon.
17313,1,Positive,"Upon opening the tube with the comb attachment , this stuff just ran out everywhere--it would be better to have someone comb it in for you--IF someone is around to assist. It is TOO WATERY and hard to keep from running down your arms. This was a waste of --HOPE the NEW product AUTO-STOP is NOT the same parc (read backwards) with a new Name packaging!!!! I'd rather the Shampoo hair color and even the Comb in GEL works GREAT if you COMB it thru your hair--you have a lot more control of its color contents....as far as TOUCH OF GRAY --its a TOUCH OF A MESS!!!"
17314,1,Positive,"I have tried using this product for several months, more like over a year. It looks good at first but The color fades! It does not last 4 to 6 weeks. Its more like 3 to 4 weeks. I have tried different shampoos and conditioners that specialize in color treated hair.I tried using the product every 4 weeks. The color fades to a very un natural and embarressing shade of I dont know how to describe it. I wash my hair everyday. Not every other day and not twice a day but everyday. I dont want to be gray but at least grey doesnt look orangegrrenish. Im very disappointed."
17315,1,Positive,Ease of use is great and results were excellent. I'm 56 and this product covered just the right amount to give me the look I wanted.
17317,2,Positive,This is easy enough to use but the color does not last long enough. The color also fades / turns bronze orange in sunlight. I have to use this weekly and its getting expensive to continue. It would be nice to have a product that the color would be more stable in sunlight and last longer. Many of the women's hair color products seem to achieve better results than this product for men.
17320,2,Positive,"Works best of the products I have tried, though I have not tried the newest product your company offers. Autostop.. However it does not seem to last very long.. and I become lazy on the next application, and the cost involved."
17323,2,Positive,Hair color changes to a brownish tinge even with the best shampoo and color conditioners
17324,2,Positive,"Easy-to-use product looks great after application, but color fades quickly - within two weeks - and hair takes on a funny, reddish/greenish tone."
17325,2,Positive,Product needs to get rid of more gray than it currently does.
17572,2,Positive,I live in the middle belt of Canada. This lotion performed well in the summer months. With the approach of fall and winter its performance gradually fell short. I had to mix other oils to try to get the moisture content I needed. Even that didn't work in winter. Those who only need moisturizing lotions for summer like weather will be happy with this. I will not be buying again.
17594,2,Positive,I give it 2 stars because it's KIND bar which I like but the taste wasn't. I thought it wasn't fresh.
17599,1,Positive,"This product does its job, it's a great powder. What I can't get past is the smell. This product smells like an old lady put on purfume to mask the moth ball door on their clothing. When my sense of smell diminishes and I no longer care about what others think or how I feel about my own body odor, I will once again use this product. Until then, it will be under the cabinet with caution tape wrapped around the container."
17600,1,Positive,"I was so disappointed that this stuff didn't work for me. I got it because of all the great reviews it had. When I used this to bake under my eyes, it just didn't look smooth. It showed every little wrinkle under my eyes and creased a little. It just didn't look great on me. :("
17601,1,Positive,"What they don't tell you about this product is it has a smell that I can old describe as an Old Lady smell If smells don't bother you, by all means get this powder and try it, but if you have a sensitive nose like I do, stay far away from it. I'd almost be willing to suffer through if I hadn't also ordered the wrong shade.... thought it would be a white powder.... it's not."
17602,1,Positive,"Although I did like how fine the powder was, the color, (translucent) was slightly pink. Not translucent. When I opened the powder, the first thing that hit me was the smell. It smells like grandma perfume. Despite the awful smell, I put a light layer on my face with the puff provided. I could smell it on my face all day! i will be returning this and going back to my favorite powder, Loreal True Match."
17603,2,Positive,"After hearing so many people rave about this product, I finally went out and bought this translucent powder and decided to grab the naturally neutral powder as well. I was so excited to use this that as soon as I got home, I applied a little bit of foundation on my face and tried out both powders. Let me tell you.. this stuff is ridiculously strong scented! I could not stand it. After a few minutes of having it on, I had to go wash it off. It started to give me a headache! And I promise, I am not exaggerating. -- With that being said.. If you can tolerate such strong scent on your face all day or don't mind it then this is for you. It does set the foundation and can qualify as a dupe for high end setting powders. As to how well it works or how long it helps.. IDK. Since I couldn't stand wearing it for more than a few minutes. I really wish it didn't have such a strong scent. I would have liked to keep it!"
17604,2,Positive,"I have seen this product floating around the beauty community on YouTube for quite sometime. And I decided to give it a shot. I was impressed with how it made my skin look at first (I have normal type skin, and not prone to acne). However, I would not buy this product ever again. It has the STRONGEST baby powder smell. It gave me a headache. It made my skin feel dewy/silky as well, like it had a film on it. But maybe that's something others will like."
17819,1,Positive,I would not purchase again. Something just didn't taste right with these.
17888,2,Positive,"It is a good product however it is way to sticky. Everytime I close my mouth and open it, my lips get stuck! I also hate having to dip my fingers into the tub everytime and then clean my fingers. Make a Coaco butter squeeze tube that is not sooo sticky!!!!"
17889,2,Positive,"It is a good product however it is way to sticky. Everytime I close my mouth and open it, my lips get stuck! I also hate having to dip my fingers into the tub everytime and then clean my fingers. Make a Coaco butter squeeze tube that is not sooo sticky!!!!"
18044,2,Positive,"the tastes is fine of course. they arrived broken and crushed. if you have dipping in mind, purchasing in store would be better."
18073,1,Positive,"'Something About Mary' is a funny film. Unfortunately, this Pan & Scan dvd version alters the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 to 1.33:1 giving a different picture than what you saw in the theater. Buy the widescreen version instead!"
18227,1,Positive,"I got to hand it to L'Oreal... they named this product perfectly. What do you call a lip colour that isn't a gloss or stain or balm or lipstick One that, upon application, seems to immediately draw all the moisture out of your lips and leave you with a tacky finish similar to drying paint Lacquer! Marketing at its finest. Yes, the packaging is eye-catching, but the applicator (think disposable eye-shadow brush), perfumed scent, and texture are certainly lacking. Or should I say lacquering"
18228,1,Positive,Was expecting much more from the ads reviews....total let down. Not recommended for any reason.
18229,2,Positive,I used this a few times and I'm not gonig to use it again. The color is not flattering. It smells kind of like alcohol. It's not shiny at all and it makes my lips dry. I was not a fan.
18230,2,Positive,"This color was much more red than I expected and it was more of a stain than a lacquer. If that's the type of product you like, then I think you'd be happy, but it wasn't for me."
18232,2,Positive,"I am a lip gloss junkie not a brand loyalist. I tried stubborn plum because it reminded me of a color I used to wear that is no longer available. The packaging is horrible. I didn't know how to open it at first- its a skew top. Then I was not impressed by the applicator. Who's lips works with this flat cotton-swap applicator. Plus the applicator absorbs most of the product, making you go through the color faster. Once I got past the bad packaging and applicator, I was not at all happy with the weird consistency. It was not glossy, kinda like a stain (not long lasting), not as bold of a color I was looking for. Oh well, I will continue on hunting for that perfect gloss."
18296,1,Positive,"1) This product was missing pieces. Not screws or nails. But actual wood pieces. Thankfully I took an inventory before assembling it and called them for replacements.2) Once I had all the pieces and began to assemble it...it was almost impossible. (I am an architect and carpenter.) Unlike other flat-packed furniture these aren't finished on all sides and the instructions don't make it clear which side the veneer faces a number of times which leads to assembling and the taking it apart and re-assembling it. That alone was infuriating enough...but even on the first attempt the screws are such low quality that the screw heads were stripped out so I had to use an extraction bit and then go buy new screws from a hardware store.3) Once I, thankfully, was done assembling it I put it in place and put my bedside lamps on it and they scratched the veneer off immediately. And the lamps have rubber feet. So you should plan on calling a glass shop to make a stand-off (just rubber bumpers) like I did to make these last more that a week.4) Lastly, just to know. This furniture isn't veneered on all sides like most furniture. Even inside the drawers. So unless you paint the inside of the drawers you will be looking at particle board when you open them which isn't a particularly elegant look.Bottom line: It looks like the picture from the outside but that's it...and only it. Buy something else instead."
18329,1,Positive,"I bought these over a month ago, and they rusted out pretty quickly. I have other Henckles knives that I love, which is why I bought them. Maybe I just got a bad batch"
18373,1,Positive,"I ordered the screen on-line and had it delivered to my home the first time. When we took it out of the box we noticed that the weld on one of the side screens was misplaced -- making the screen appear above the frame and a big black painted weld was on top of the frame instead of on the back where it couldn't be seen.Returned the screen to my local store and ordered a new one to be delivered to the store. Went in to pick it up and asked the clerk to take it out of the box to inspect it. Weld wasn't a problem this time but instead there was black paint ""globbed"" all over the bottom of the screen. It wouldn't brush off so I told them to return it.Very disappointed -- loved the design -- it would have been perfect. Can't believe a company couldn't catch those issues before boxing up the product. Very poor quality control."
18374,1,Positive,"Received in timely manner and the box was completely intact. While I was taking the screen out of the box, one of the welds on the hinge broke. I carried it back to Home Depot and purchased another screen."
18426,1,Positive,I used to LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I would buy 4 cans at a time. Sometime in the last 5 months or so the formula changed. It smells sweeter like perfume and just doesn't hold my hair the way that the previous formula did. I was extremely disappointed. I wish that they would have left the original formula alone. It was perfect.
18428,1,Positive,"I'm always on the look out for products that will give my hair lift and volume. I tried this product because I had a coupon and there was only one bottle left on the shelf, it had to be good right Unfortunately, the only thing this product gave me was a headache. The scent is very strong. Every time I used it, I would get a bad sinus headache. I have fine thin hair and it's in a pixie cut. I think I would have the ideal hair type for this product, but it was dud for me. I used this as directed with no real results. I then tried to use this in a few different ways, but still no volume or lift. I'll stick to my normal hair care products for now! )"
18430,1,Positive,"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one with this problem. I keep purchasing this product in the hopes that it will work until the can is empty. I've returned two some months ago and took a chance and purchased a third one. Today it finally quit spraying even though I tried running it under hot water thinking the nozzle was clogged. Can't imagine what the problem is but I do hope it can be resolved, soon. I do like this product."
18431,1,Positive,I have used lots of L'Oreal products in the past and have been happy with them. I can't even tell you if this product worked well because my first time using it I could not get the can to spray!!!! It's very disappointing when you are excited to try something and never get the chance because of a default of the can!!!
18433,1,Positive,"Although this spray works effectively at holding the hair, the smell is so powerful and you can actual taste even the tiniest spritz. Would not recommend to anyone."
18434,1,Positive,"I adore the mousse like this spray. I am starting to grow out a style and decided the spray would work better. The first two uses were awesome, but then the nozzle clogged and no product will come out. It is still losing air though. I have taken off the nozzle, soaked it in hot water, scrubbed it with a nail brush--but nothing has worked. I love the price of this line and how my hair looks, but the Boost It-High Lift Creation Spray is a bust."
18466,2,Positive,It did not help my dry lips much and definitely did not last long. I will not order this again.
18483,2,Positive,"Great pasta but the cheese sauce was a bit waxy, the shells with cheese is a better sauce."
18485,1,Positive,The product just started dripping. I called Delta and was told that you need to have the original receipt. I bought it about ten years ago. Good luck tracking down a ten year old receipt. I would give Delta zero stars if I could. Buy something different.
18543,1,Positive,The Movie Was Alright And The Acting Was Ok Too. B-}
18556,2,Positive,"I really wanted to like this lip balm, but the smell is just overpowering. It smells like a cross between VERY strong honey, and very strong fake rose. The consistency is good, the feeling on your lips is good (not too greasy, not too dry), but after about 5 minutes, I couldn't take the smell anymore had to wipe it off. If you don't mind strong smells, then this might be a good lip balm. If you want something that smells subtle , I highly suggest you find a different product than this one."
18570,1,Positive,I love that these are so convenient and smell great. So much easier than finding a cleaning spray and paper towels. I absolutely LOVE. Thanks Clorox
18571,1,Positive,I would have given this product a 5 star review just a couple months ago. The new fragrance gives me migraines and leaves the house smelling like chemicals. Please bring back the old smell!
18572,1,Positive,"I was expecting these wipes to have a strong clorox smell but they don't, they actually have a refreshing fragrance. I use them regularly and feel confident that I'm eliminating germs from every surface on which I use them."
18573,1,Positive,"I have used Clorox Wipes for years... Cannot live without them (or prefer not to). Now the smell is so irritating, I will have to purchase another brand to continue my Spring cleaning. I've never had such a strong objection to the smell of any cleaning product. Please at least offer a choice in the old vs. new formula."
18575,1,Positive,"LOVE Clorox wipes, but this batch is horrible. The wipes have separated and won't come out of canister in one piece. They rip and tear apart which then makes using 1 wipe useless. You have to get several out just to clean something. The smell is great tho."
18576,1,Positive,"I would give ZERO stars to the New Formula Clorox Wipes. I agree with all the other users that say the new formula smells awful. It may cut grease now but I liked the old streak free formula a lot better and it smelled nice. Whatever is in the new formula that cuts grease also makes my hands burn. I've switched to my store brand now since they work just as well as the new formula and they smell better. And they don't make my hands burn when I use them! And they don't leave streaks all over my bathroom counters, mirrors and stove like the Clorox wipes do now. Everyone (including me) used to love Clorox wipes when they first came out. Learn a lesson Clorox- if it isn't broke, don't try to fix it!"
18577,1,Positive,"I purchaed 12443842 for 3.28 and 25483701 for 6.37 - the formulas are exactly the same but the prices are drastically different! http://www.walmart.com/ip/Clorox-Disinfecting-Bathroom-Cleaner-30-Fl-Oz/12443842 http://www.walmart.com/ip/Clorox-Company-COX16930-Clorox-Disinfecting-Bathroom-Cleaner-30-oz/25483701 each bottle reads: Ative Ingredients: n-Alkyl (60 C14, 30 C16, 5 C12, 5 C18) 0.1375 dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride n-Alkyl (68 C12, 32 C14) 0.1375 dimethyl ethlbenzyl ammonium choride 99.7250 other ingredients 100.0000 total"
18578,1,Positive,"When pulling out a wipe they NEVER come out right. Many time they come out too thin,other times the entire roll tries to come out. Something has changed as this was never an issue before. Be cause it was not an issue i buy the large container."
18579,1,Positive,"I normally buy Clorox brand disinfecting wipes over generic wipes because I like the Fresh Scent. I notice that you've changed the scent and strongly dislike it. While I'll look for Lavender scent in the future, I suspect it does not have wide distribution."
18581,1,Positive,"I have a Kohler Devonshire acrylic tub and cultured marble tub surround and vanity top/sinks. For years I have used Scrub Free, which is safe for acrylic tubs and cultured marble. Now, I cannot find this product locally. A friend has the same tub, which she purchased on my recommendation. She cleans it with Lysol Bathroom Cleaner, but although it is approved by Kohler, the product label says not to use it on acrylic. I decided to test the Lysol product and Clorox Disinfecting Bathroom Cleaner, which is also approved by Kohler. Plus, the label says it is safe to use on plastics. The Lysol product did a good job - the tested locations on tub and countertop were shiny when rinsed and dried. However the Clorox product left the test spots on the tub and counter dull, and I was really afraid it had done damage to the finish. But after cleaning with the Lysol product, the Clorox test areas were smooth and shiny again. I do not recommend using this product on acrylic."
18582,2,Positive,"I used to love these wipes but recently something has changed in the quality of the paper used. They were great for wiping down the table or counter but now there are lots of little fibers left behind. This makes the table look dirtier than when I started and means I need to go back through with another towel to finish the clean up, which defeats the purpose of convenience wipes."
20637,1,Positive,"The conditioner was worse than the shampoo, did absolutely nothing if not made my scalp more itchy."
20638,1,Positive,Smells good and liked the way it made my hair feel but did nothing for my scalp.
20730,1,Positive,I really wanted to like this but it left me sticky feeling all day.
20762,2,Positive,"If we had not already used this heater, we would have returned it. Bought it to warm up our bathroom before a shower. It does not get warm enough. We put it on high about a half hour before taking a shower & only slightly warmer. This is a small bathroom about 8 x 8. We do have tile floors & a granite top on the vanity so maybe that makes a difference....harder to heat.Suggest buying a bigger heater with more wattage."
20780,1,Positive,"I love salt and vinegar chips, but these Lay's Salt and Vinegar chips are patheticWhat I love about them:Inexpensive - compared to other brands of potato chips, these are cheap and are often on saleEasy to find in stores - compared to other brands of potato chips, these are extremely easy to find in stores, and available just about everywhereSalty - these chips are very salty and you taste the salt in every biteWhat I don't like about them:Too much vinegar - these chips have way too much vinegar and have an unpleasing bitter taste to themSoggy/wet feeling and consistency - these chips have a very soggy and wet consistency to them. They feel filmy, like vinegar film, not like salt film, and have a very soggy overall taste that lessens the crunch. They don't feel wet, but the consistency is wet, very unappetizingNot very crunchy - unlike other brands of salt and vinegar chips, these are not very crispy. They are very thin, slightly thicker than paper, and don't really have much of a crispness to speak ofAlways broken chips - every time I've ever purchased this brand of salt and vinegar chips, whether online or in a store, the chips are almost always broken all throughout the bag. The bag is very thin, compared to other brands, and the chips are always brokenAt the end of the day, these are terrible salt and vinegar chips and there are so many tastier and crispier varieties out there, that I no longer consider this brand"
20797,1,Positive,"I installed this the first of the year in 2014. Medium sized is a bit of a stretch. Wish I would have brought bigger because the wood splits must be small to fit in this stove. The spring handles supplied (2) never were able to stay on. The blower unit which came with this stove began making a loud rattling sound after only three weeks of operation. After the stove gets hot and fired up, it does put out a decent amount of heat for its size."
20798,1,Positive,"1800 sq. Ft., not on your best day. Heats 600 sq. Ft. Good. You may have some hot coals after 6 hrs. But the burn time is more like 3 hrs. Logs must be split very small. I thought maybe the bad reviews were because it wasn't being dampered properly, not the case. The good reviews must be employees. Tried it on a 30 degree night in October, not looking forward to January and February. I guess you get what you pay for, lesson learned!"
20799,1,Positive,"This stove is far from medium size. The fire box cant fit 2 4"" diameter logs side by side and if there is anymore than 2 inches of coals good luck putting wood in it without having flaming chunks fall out. Don't count on overnight fire unless you jam as much wood as you possibly can in every Crack and crevis around the wood at 11 at night only then you may still feel some heat at 3:30 am. You need to clean the ash/coals every day or 2 otherwise the build up to muchOn a positive note the stove is easy to light and easy to control the fire. It does throw some serious heat wide open but eats wood rather quickly that way and you will only get 2 hrs per load."
20800,1,Positive,I had my new woodstove installed and it was not only missing the handles (which means I have to use a pot holder to open the door) but the door gasket came apart immediately and I can't run it without smoke setting off my fire alarms.I called the company directly and no one will call me back and address these issues. So I'm stuck with a woodstove that is already installed and wish I would have purchased somewhere else.
20801,1,Positive,"We bought this stove online. That was our first mistake. The dimensions that it showed online were way off. Second, The stove has a huge scratch on top that I will have to fix. The welds are horrible as was the factory assembly. We will be taking it back and buying one somewhere else in person."
20802,1,Positive,"I installed this the first of the year in 2014. ""Medium"" sized is a bit of a stretch. Wish Iwould have brought bigger because the wood splits must be small to fit in this stove.The spring handles supplied (2) never were able to stay on. The blower unit whichcame with this stove began making a loud rattling sound after only three weeks ofoperation. After the stove gets hot and fired up, it does put out a decent amount of heat for its size."
20803,2,Positive,"To be honest, I grew up with an amazing old cast iron wood burning stove and have been pretty spoiled by its longevity and quality. I am now building my own home and needed a medium size stove for my small space. I had done my research and this Pleasant Hearth stove seemed like a good fit. I took careful note of the measurements because my husband and I wanted a firebox big enough for medium to large pieces of wood. We have NOT tested the stove yet as it is still summer, however, just on first inspection, it had some issues...When we went to pick up the stove, a forklift brought it over to our car on what turned out to be a broken (crushed to pieces!) pallet so that when we drove it over an hour to our house, it leaned frighteningly in the back. We would have asked for a different pallet but the stove itself was screwed to what was left of one of the slats. Fortunately, none of the legs were bent.When we got the stove home and unwrapped it, I was SHOCKED at how small the actual firebox opening is! PLEASE NOTE: the picture online and on the box of the stove is seriously misleading: the picture shows a huge glowing fire behind a lovely glass door. In reality, the glass door is way bigger than where you actually stick the wood in so when you are looking at your nice glowing fire, you only really see a small narrow section of it.Another issue that has yet to be seriously tested is the spot welding all over the stove. The big stove I grew up with is welded all around very securely. This Pleasant Hearth stove has all of these weird little spots of welding here and there that I 'm concerned may not stand the test of time.My last major issue with this stove is the coiled wire handles that come with it. There are two of them and the instructions say they should ""screw on"" easily. NOT the case! My husband spent two hours cranking on them and tooling them to fit.Like I said, we have not used the stove yet. It has not gotten us through a winter yet. I am hoping that it will. Overall, for $800, I wish that it had been closer to perfect."
20804,2,Positive,"came with a couple of cracked bricks but they sent new ones out within 3 days. I went through the break in heating and all was well until my first full fire. the paint started flaking off all over the top of it. it was reading 370 degrees with a digital thermometer. exhaust pipe was 310 so even with the vent fully closed as they say to do after it is fully heated.. most of the heat was escaping. not as efficient as they advertise.. it burns on low for a good 5 hrs at the most with a full load of dry seasoned wood. the glass gets dirty quick. its a decent built stove, but it already looks 10 yrs old within the first 3 weeks of operating it. needs to be cleaned a lot and kind of hard to do because you have to lift the brick out of the middle to put the ashes in the pan. decent stove, good heat, but a lot goes out the chimney. the blower is kind of noisy and really doesn't put out much air anyway...it would be great for a cabin or workshop. but as a center piece in your home, I would spend more money on a better quality one. ive had the catylic type before and it was a pain as well. my suggestion is when buying a stove, spend the money. you will only have to do it once and it will pay for itself. decent stove, if it were 200 cheaper I would say buy one of you don't mind a old looking black iron stove. it heats up my 1500 sq ft home. but I have to get up in the middle of the night to add wood and stoke it again. it will not burn for 8 to 10 hrs as advertised.. 5 at the most. you will have coals that are hot after 7 hrs. but that's it. and that is fully closed damper on the lowest setting. it goes about an hr or so on full on heat. kinda like a steam engine. you need to keep shoveling wood in it if you want full heat on a freezing day!!"
20852,2,Positive,The chips were good but he packaging was very poor and they were all smashed up.
20878,1,Positive,"The item did not taste fresh. Interestingly, that was the second stale bag of Todtitos chips I had purchase."
20883,1,Positive,"Well I didn't get to enjoy this product because when I opened my box the chips were everywhere, and I was highly upset. Now I know that I can never order chips from Walmart again."
20884,1,Positive,"I love Tostitos Tortilla Chips, but I didn't get to eat any of these because the bag was completely opened, like someone had cut it open with scissors from one end to the other. Half the bag was gone and several of them were scattered around the box. This was more than a shipping problem, it appears someone had a snack."
20886,2,Positive,Taste was good but most if not all were broken into small pieces
21140,1,Positive,"I have used your previous version of gel for many years and it was awesome. Now, you go and change the formula and the scent and it is awful. The gel is nowhere near the same product and the scent overpowers cologne. Please go back to the old version."
21141,1,Positive,The new formula does not work for me. It does not give me the volume or hold and it dulls the shine of my hair. The old formula was great for my hair. Now I will be shopping for another gel that works.
21142,1,Positive,I have used Nexxus products for over 20 years. The changes in the new Extra gel have resulted in me searching for other products. I have always liked the hold and the subtle scent of the Extra gel. The new formula is thin and the smell is overwhelming to the point that I can not wear it.
21143,1,Positive,Have been using Nexxus sculpting gel for maybe 3/4 years and now in 2017 you changed your formula and I don't appreciate the product any longer. New formula makes my hair stiff and difficult to comb and style after use. Want to know how could I possibly get the old product back as it was perfect for me. This new one states it gives texture and it just does differently than your old product gel. Please give me info on how to purchase my old Nexxus sculpting gel. Am shopping for a different product now to replace your former gel product. Help.
21144,1,Positive,I loved the old Exxtra Gel. I used it for years and have always feared that I wouldn't be able to find it. It held my hair in place exactly as I desired all day. This new formula has an overwhelming smell. And it holds your hair for about 15 minutes. I may as well put water through my hair. I have read review after review on this new formula which agree with me. Please go back to the original formula. Nexxus has lost my business.
21147,1,Positive,I loved the old formula and used it every day. Tried to use the new one and tossed it after a couple of times. It's so bad for my hair type that I couldn't even finish the tube! I won't buy anymore Nexxus products unless the old formula or something similar comes back.
21149,1,Positive,Please change the gel back to one of the old formulas. This one doesn't hold my hair all day and I do not like the smell at all.
21151,1,Positive,"I've been using exxtra gel for years, but now my hair is frizzy with no curl definition. Now I need to find a whole new product."
21152,1,Positive,Used the original extra gel forever and loved it. Had to wash my hair after using it for two hours. The scent was sickening.
21155,1,Positive,Been using it for 20 years.now have to look for a new gel after you changed the formula and added the smell.
21157,1,Positive,Nexxus has clearly taken this product to an overpriced and over scented cheap hair gel. Everything about it is worse.
21158,1,Positive,"I do not like this gel, the old one was amazing, now I'm forced to look for something different."
21161,1,Positive,"SO SAD THEY CHANGED THE FORMULA, LOVED IT THE WAY IT WAS."
21163,1,Positive,Been using this product for over 15 years. Why would they change a good thing Please bring back the old formula
21167,1,Positive,"Different ingredients in new product (oils) not good for fine, thin hair that needs volume. Bring back old product!!!!"
21169,1,Positive,What happened The old formula was one of the best on the market. The new one is truly awful! Please please please get rid of it and bring back the good stuff!
21172,1,Positive,Have used Nexxus gel over 20 years and will be changing now.The new formula is weaker then the old one and the fragrance is too strong.
21173,1,Positive,this new formula does NOT hold nearly as well and has way too much fragrance. Searching the internet to find the old version. Bring it back!!!
21176,1,Positive,The new product in to thin so I have to use to much. The smell it overpowering. The old product in the gray container was prefect.
21177,1,Positive,been using this gel for 20 years and it's not the same. Now im looking for something that works like the old one. Bring back the old gel.
21178,1,Positive,The new product is very strong smelling and gave me a headache. I will not be using it in the future.
21182,1,Positive,I do not like the new formula and will try other gels. The old Exxtra Gel was great.
21184,1,Positive,not buy it again the old one was perfect the new is like others ship with poor quality
21186,1,Positive,1st time purchasing in the new bottle. The gel seemed watery I don't care for the fragrance.
21187,1,Positive,Some things are better left unchanged this is definitely an example of that
21188,1,Positive,"Bring back the old product, will not be buying this new formula again."
21190,1,Positive,The New hair gel has too much fragrance. I Liked the original fragrance.
21192,1,Positive,Did not like prefer the original gel Professional extra gel
21200,1,Positive,Why is all I would like to know. Don't like the new formula. Just wasted my money buying it. Need to find something new now after many years of using the same product.
21204,1,Positive,"After using this product for many, many years, it has been changed and it is nothing like the original product. It is not at all effective as a styling gel."
21206,1,Positive,I have been using all your products for about 20 years. I just want the old gel back. PLEASE!!!!
21209,1,Positive,This stuff is not as good as the old gel was. The old gel held my hair in place much better then this new stuff. Please tell me you will go back to the old Gel
21210,1,Positive,So sad they changed the product.. I have used the old gold tube for years and I bought the new pink tube and the scent is nice but the gel is not the same.... Need to find a different product. The a gel was soooo much better!
21215,1,Positive,The new formula is horrible......please bring back the old one!!!!
21216,1,Positive,The new formula does not hold like the old. It is greasy and smells bad. The old formula worked great so why change. Please bring back old formula!
21218,1,Positive,Been using Nexxus Extra Gel for 18 years. Product was the Best in the market until I recently purchased the new formula gel last month. Please bring the original formula back. Currently searching for a new replacement.
21221,1,Positive,"I was a faithful costumer for 15+ years! My hair is now dry, curls are unrefined, frizzy, the smell is way toooo strong, please please bring back old formula!!!!"
21222,1,Positive,I've relied on the old formula for 20 years to create body for my baby-fine straight hair. The new formula does not do the trick. I'll have to try other brands until I find a gel comparable to the old formula.
21223,1,Positive,"My wife and I have used the old gel for many years, hold was perfect! New formula does not hold as well, consistency is completely different and the fragrance is overwhelming. Used twice and stopped, they out full tube!"
21226,1,Positive,I have been using Nexxus Exxtra gel for over a decade...until you changed the formula and fragrance. The new gel formula does not hold as well and the fragrance is HORRENDOUS!!! Your former loyal customer
21227,1,Positive,I have used this product for years on my naturally curly hair and now I have to find a new product! You ruined a perfectly good gel. The new formula is terrible and does not hold my curls! Change the formula back!
21228,1,Positive,"The new product is a huge downgrade. The water and alcohol content cheapens the quality and the product, Please bring back the old product"
21229,1,Positive,"I have been using this gel for a very long time and Loved it..sorry to say the new fragrance is awful and I will have to find a new product to use. Why, Why, Why do you have to mess with a great product!!!"
21231,1,Positive,"Why did you change this product I am now looking for a new gel. It seems every time I find a product I really like, the company either discontinues it or changes it."
21232,1,Positive,This product is so inferior to the original that I am amazed that you have not figured that out yet. The new does not hold at all and the gel leaks out from the top. Please bring back the original.
21235,1,Positive,"I've used this product for years and loved it. However, with the new packaging came a new scent - can't stand it. I will not be able to use this product again and would never recommend it to anyone."
21238,1,Positive,So upset that nexxus changed their gel. It was my favorite for years until it changed. I can't use this new gel. Dries my hair out. I have to find a new gel.
21239,1,Positive,I have used this gel for 20 years and always loved it. They recently changed the formula including the scent and it's horrible. . The hold is different. It's not as good. PLEASE BRING THE OLD GEL BACK.
21241,1,Positive,I have used this product for years for my curls and ABSOLUTELY love it! But it has been changed and it not nearly as good. PLEASE bring back the old formula in the gold tube!
21242,1,Positive,I was a faithful user of the original Gel I absolutely loved it but this new stuff is horrible whoever decided to change this should be fired!
21245,1,Positive,I have used the gel for 20 plus years...the new/revised product does not work nearly as well nor do I like the fragrance.
21246,1,Positive,I used the discontinued gel for decades and I do not like this new gel. It doesn't hold as well and does not provide the shine that the old gel provided. The smell is too strong and I get a headache by the end of the day from the smell. Please bring the old gel back!
21247,1,Positive,I'VE BEEN USING EXXTRA GEL FOR YEARS. I HAVE SHORT STRAIGHT HAIR NOW AFTER LOSING IT TO CHEMOTHERAPY AND LOVED THE BODY AND CONTROL THE EXXTRA GEL PROVIDED. THE NEW FORMULA ADDS NO BODY OR CONTROL WHATSOEVER. I'M RETURNING IT TO THE STORE TO GET MY MONEY BACK.
21248,1,Positive,I have been using exxtra gel since 2000. My hair is huge and frizzy. I have tried every product under the sun and exxtra gel is always the winner. Now you have changed the formula and I can see that most are not happy. Please change it back. Please and thank you
21250,1,Positive,The original product was great! The new product does not even come close to holding the hair as the original did. The new fragrance is also not pleasant. PLEASE bring back the original Nexus Gel Exxtra!!!!!!!!!!
21251,1,Positive,"The old gel is better, please it bring back. I don't like the smell of the new gel and it's too watery. A bottle of the old gel lasted for at least 2 weeks, the new gel 1 week."
21252,1,Positive,"I've been using exxtra gel since it came out 18,19 years ago and with the change I will not purchase it again looking for a new hair gel as we speak."
21253,1,Positive,"I have used your previous version of gel for many years and it was awesome. Now, you go and change the formula and the scent and it is awful. The gel is nowhere near the same product and the scent overpowers cologne. Please go back to the old version."
21254,1,Positive,"I have been using this gel for over 10 yrs, i have curly hair and the old gel made my culrs look great, never frizzy. The new formula is terrible, i have lots of frizz and my scalp is itchy. I'm looking for a new product, if anyone finds a great one please post."
21256,1,Positive,Absolutely does not give the firm hold the old formula did. Wish you could offer the old formula in addition to the new and see which sells better. Really miss the old product. Can't find a substitute that comes close. Love your shampoo and conditioner though!
21257,1,Positive,I have used this gel for 23 years and always loved it. They recently changed the formula including the scent and it's horrible. my hair smells like an old lady. The hold is different. It's not as good. I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL PLEASE BRING THE OLD GEL BACK.
21260,1,Positive,Nexxus Exxtra Gel is no longer a product I will buy. The formulation has changed it does not perform anything akin to the previous product. I've been using this product for many years and will look for a replacement product.
21261,1,Positive,I have been using this product for many years until recently the entire formula was changed. I am not happy with the new formula and I would like to know if I can purchase any of the old formula.
21264,1,Positive,"Does not hold, why would you change a great product I have used this for years and years. The only product for my fine hair. I am returning my tube to the store. Please bring back the old formula soon! I would give this product zero's if I could."
21265,1,Positive,"I have been using Nexxus EXXTRA Gel for year. I just bought one and its not the same. New formula has a strong perfume scent and it just dried my hair. I loved the old Nexxus Exxtra Gel, not this new one. They should of changed the packaging only. gelfail"
21267,1,Positive,I have used the old formula for almost 20 years the current product has less hold and it smells like a hospital antiseptic. Please bring the old formula back -- call it Classic Exxtra Hold or something.
21268,1,Positive,This product is a major drop off from a product I have used for nearly twenty years. I have one tube left of the old product and it is hands down better than the new scent. Like all the other reviews I am finding a replacement for gel at this time.
21270,1,Positive,Have used this product for years and loved it. The new formula feels terrible in your hand and in your hair. Not even close to the original and the new scent is overpowering and not needed. Need to find a tube of the original before it's too late...
21271,1,Positive,"NEXXUS IS NOW PAST TENSE, YOU LET ME DOWN, FIRST VERSASTYER AND NOW THE OLD BEST EXXTRA GEL.. YOU RUINED MY LIFE, I FINALLY FOUND YOU AND NOW IT IS GONE IN AN INSTANT. THE ONLY PRODUCTS THAT WAS A DEFENSE AGAINST HUMIDITY FOR MY UNRULY HAIR GONE .."
21272,1,Positive,"What a disappointment with my recent purchase of Exxtra Gel! The formula changed. The first and only day I used it, I sneezed and had a runny nose all day. The fragrance is overpowering. The hold is not as good either. Why did you mess with perfection"
21273,1,Positive,"I don't like the new Professional gel...it's gluey feeling and takes forever to blow dry. I liked the crisp finish the old formula left on my hair. And, the old finish would rejuvenate during the day when I ran wet hands through my hair."
21274,1,Positive,"The old formula was much better. It stopped my hair from frizzing. It also helped define the curls. Unfortunately, I am now looking for a different brand of Gel to switch to. The sent is also way to strong. Please bring back the old formula!"
21277,1,Positive,"Used the Nexxus gel for over 20 years and liked the way it would hold my hair. The new formula is too watery, has no hold to it and has a strong smell. Why try to fix something that's not broken. Please bring back the old formula ."
21279,1,Positive,Unfortunately I have used the old formula because it worked better then all the other stuff out there. The new formula is the same as all the other cheap gels on the shelf. This was not a great change and I have to find a new gel.
21280,1,Positive,The new formula does not work for me. It does not give me the volume or hold and it dulls the shine of my hair. The old formula was great for my hair. Now I will be shopping for another gel that works.
21285,1,Positive,We have used the old product for years. The new product has a distinctly unpleasant odor but even more importantly it is watery and doesn't work. Fortunately I found a store that still had several tubes of the old product. Unless Nexxus brings back the old formula we will be shopping for another brand.
21286,1,Positive,I have been using the Nexxus Exxtra Gel for many years and have been very happy with its performance...until the change in packaging and formula. The new formula does nothing for my hair except make it feel weighed down and dirty. I will be looking for a new product. This new version is horrible!
21287,1,Positive,"The container seam has split open on the last two purchases about 1/2 way through the product, making it messy and difficult to use. I hope you will be able to correct the problem it is a real inconvenience."
21289,1,Positive,"I had been using the old formula for a great number of years an loved it. The new formula is thinner, has a stronger fragrance which competes with my cologne and has less hold. I can't image why Nexxus would find this to be an improvement. NOT a good move. I want my old product back!!!"
21290,1,Positive,Can't stand the new product--had to return it all. The smell was more than I could stand. Sad----the old product was great and I relied on it for years for both its holding power and decent smell. Hey Nexxus----ever heard of Focus Groups
21291,1,Positive,I have used this gel for several years and loved it. The new formula's scent is awful and the gel doesn't hold my hair like the old formula. I will not buy another tube of this gel. I don't understand why it was changed in the first place.
21292,1,Positive,I've been using this gel for years and the new formula isn't working. I have pretty dry and coarse hair so I love the wet look to keep it tame and this new bottle doesn't hold my hair at all like the old. The new formula makes my hair look like straw after 20 minutes. PLEASE BRING THE OLD BACK!!!
21295,1,Positive,"Like the other reviewers I used your Exxtra hold styling gel for 15+ years. The new gel is lighter somehow and does not offer Exxtra hold. The new scent is ok, but the more watery and less gel like composition of your new product is a non starter for me. Please, bring back the original!"
21296,1,Positive,I have used the Nexxus gel for many years but was disappointed with the scent of the new product. Unfortunately the scent is too strong for my taste and I will be finding a new hair gel. I wish I would have known about the change because I would have stocked up on the old version.
21299,1,Positive,"I was an advis user of Nexxus Extra Gel. I recently purchased a new bottle. I absolutely LOVE the fragrance, however they must have changed the formula because my curls are not the same. I wish they would go back to the original formula. It's just not the same. Sorry Nexxus."
21302,1,Positive,Not the same formula! No hold. Why did you change a great thing I am returning this tube to the store. I will not buy this again unless you bring back the old formula that I used and loved for years. Would rate a zero if I could.
21305,1,Positive,I have used this product for over 15 years. It WAS the best. The new formula is sticky and it stinks. Please bring back the old formula. I've noticed that everyone agrees. Why did you change it
21308,1,Positive,"Please bring back the old one, as others I have been using it for years and was very satisfied. I am bringing the new one back to the store and going to try to find a new gel that doesn't stink."
21311,1,Positive,"The previous product (Exxtra Gel) worked great, but now the new product (the same brand as before) does not work at all, the strength of which is not enough to hold the hair style. Can you tell me the difference"
21314,1,Positive,"New products is terrible. Yes it smells but consistency is like water. It does not hold my curls like original product. They took away my favorite shampoo, now my gel. Looks like it's time to change product line all together."
21315,1,Positive,Not happy with this new formula. The smell is bothersome and it is very runny. The old formula was thicker and had a pleasant smell. I have been using this product for years and I am sad I have to find something new to use.
21316,1,Positive,"I have been using this product for almost 20 years and love it for my curly hair. But since the formula changed, it does not hold the curls and leaves my hair frizzy by the end of the day. Please please bring back the old formula!!!"
21317,1,Positive,I have used Nexxus EXXTRA Gel for almost 20 years and am very upset that the formula has changed. It does not compare with the old Gel and I don't like the strong smell. Please give us our old formula back. If you don't I have to find something else.
21318,1,Positive,"Simply put, the new product does not work. Have been a loyal customer for years but will have to switch. This was a big mistake in changing the formula as you will definitely lose long-term customers. I hope you reconsider your decision and bring the old formulation back."
21322,1,Positive,I have been using this product for many years and it was superior to all others on the market. I just bought a new tube two weeks ago and it different. It no longer holds my hair in place and is much more watery. I will no longer buy this product as it is.
21323,1,Positive,New formula smells bad and does not hold like the old formula. I also had a problem where the tube broke open on the side and started leaking. The packaging feels and looks real cheap. After 10 plus years of using this product I'm now looking for a new gel.
21324,1,Positive,"I HAVE BEEN USING THE PREVIOUS GEL PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND WHEN I WENT TO PURCHASE A NEW ONE SINCE MINE RAN OUT , I BOUGHT THIS ONE I USED IT ONCE AND WITHIN 6 HOURS OF USING IT, I HAD TO REWASH MY HAIR BECAUSE I COULDN'T STAND THE SMELL! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
21327,1,Positive,I used to use the Nexxus Exxtra Gel all the time before they changed to product and added fragrance. The gel did not hold up well anymore and my hair smelled like a woman kind of hard to use it when your man. Wish they still had the old non fragranced gel.
21328,1,Positive,"The original Nexxus Styling Gel was amazing! Please offer the original back. We are forced to seek a new gel after being with Nexxus for over 15 years. The new formula is horrible: hold is not as good, smells terrible, seems like alcohol or similar to the basic cheap gels."
21329,1,Positive,Customer for 5 years / Found Alternative Product but would be Happy to become a Loyal Customer Again if the product is returned to its Original Formula.
21334,1,Positive,"I have been using Nexxus Extra Gel for a very LONG time. Will stop using since the new product (bronze casing) came out. It is totally ineffective and is a major step down from original product. No longer keeps my hair in place and in actuality, does nothing good for my hair. Will look for better product outside of Nexxus."
21336,1,Positive,"I loved this product before the recent change. I would go anywhere to find it, but it has changed in the last couple of months to a terrible formula with far too much perfume. it went from being in a class all it's own to just another over scented, under performing hair gel. I will now be on the hunt for a new product."
21340,1,Positive,"Why on earth did you change the formula of the Nexxus Salon Hair Care Exxtra Gel, Superior Hold Not only does the new reformulation not have the same strong holding capacity as the old product, the fragrance is obnoxious and too powerful. My coworkers are all complaining about the smell, and it's causing them to sneeze!"
21345,1,Positive,Not nearly as good as before. The scent is not good. The gel seems runnier and does not hold as well. Just bring back the old formula!!!! I would switch back if I could get the old gel!!!! For now I have moved on to a better product.
21346,1,Positive,I have used the Exxtra Gel product for well over 15 years. The recent change and new formula is thinned out (low viscosity) and now has a heavy hair spray scent. You guys ruined a really great product. Sadly I'm looking to buy up all the remaining old formal I can find and then when I run out I'll look else where.
21350,1,Positive,"I have used this gel forever and loved it!! WHY did you change the formula It does now have a different 'smell', which I like, but the gel now does nothing for my hair, when before this change it managed my hair beautifully. Guess I'm off to find a new gel....so sorry to leave Nexxus behind...."
21352,1,Positive,"I have course, curly, long hair and I was using your Exxtra Gel in the grey bottle. It really held my hair nicely in almost any weather. When you replaced it recently, I tried it and was really upset. It doesn't hold my hair as nice and the scent is awful. It smells like a men's cheap cologne. Why did you go and change a product that was perfect"
21353,1,Positive,"The NEW formula has very weak hold capability and smells of baby powder...I've been using this Gel for over 18 years and loved it! I think Nexxus saved money by using a less-effective ingredient and tried to make it look improved with the copper-looking bottle -- garbage compared to the OLD formula!!! Thanks RD, I need to find a new Gel now!"
21356,1,Positive,As a 10+ year user I truly am confused why they would change the formula...there is clearly nothing better from feel to scent in the new formula...I now have to search for a new option...given the price point and efficacy of the new formula nexus is no longer a option...hopefully they will bring back the old formula...and I will be back
21360,1,Positive,I used the old formula for years and loved it's consistency and smell. It did not gunk up my hair or flake. This new version is awful and I will not buy another product from your company until you bring back the old formula.
21363,1,Positive,"Very displeased with the new formula that does not work well in my hair. I am now forced to buy a new product and sadly, I've been buying this product for many years. Been seeing the same types of reviews-on this product-all over the Internet. Hope Nexxus brings back the old formula when they realize that the new just isn't as good..."
21365,1,Positive,"I agree with the individual who posted earlier. I do not like the change to the new formula at all. I have used this styling gel for 20 years (maybe more), and this new formula does not have the consistency or the holding power that the old gel had. This one feels more like water with an alcoholic smell. Why did you change this"
21367,1,Positive,I've used Exxtra Gel for 20 years - it WAS the best styling product on the market. New formula smells like body odor and it doesn't perform as well. HORRIBLE!!! I used it and had to wash my hair to get the odor out!!! PLEASE bring back the original formula. Why did you change such a great product
21368,1,Positive,"I have used the previous version of this for about 20 years. The new version has a strong, talcum powder/baby oil smell and does not hold. Switching to another brand if the old version is no longer available. Bad decision by whoever the product manager is. Wife bought 2 bottles not knowing and they are going in the recycle bin."
21369,1,Positive,I have been using EXTRA GEL ever since I can remember. Until recently I was getting it in the grey tube and one day I couldn't find it anymore and picked up the EXXTRA GEL I used it for a week and found that it does not work like the old product and it also stinks. I was lucky to find a tube of the old product but now it has run out and I am stuck trying to find something else. Please go back to the old formula IT WORKS!!!
21370,1,Positive,This new product doesn't hold and makes my hair frizzy.
21372,1,Positive,"I have used Nexxus Exxtra Gel for years and just purchased a new tube. I am very disappointed in the new product. It has made my hair oily and I do not like the scent. I will be looking for a replacement product on my next shopping trip. I can't imagine why you changed something that was so good to begin with. Also, the new tube has a lot more ingredients than my old tube. Please go back to the original recipe."
21377,1,Positive,"I have used Nexxus for years, I have fine hair, it was the best gel I had ever used. But no more, it is thin and smells like dish soap. The new tube does not make it any better. I wish I had known they were going to change it. I would have bought a boat load of the old gel."
21378,1,Positive,I have used Nexxus products for over 20 years. The changes in the new Extra gel have resulted in me searching for other products. I have always liked the hold and the subtle scent of the Extra gel. The new formula is thin and the smell is overwhelming to the point that I can not wear it.
21379,1,Positive,I have been hunting for the grey/tan bottle for months but can only find themes rose colored tube gel. Please go back to the grey tube. The old formula was perfect for my curls. I can't find any products out there now that I like including the new rose bottle. It just doesn't hold anything! Besides I used to get so many compliments with the old formula now I just look like a frizz ball!! So sad!!
21380,1,Positive,"Please bring back the old formula! I echo the voice of many here. I have used Exxtra Gel for many years. I have straight hair. The old formula helped style my hair and the shine could not be touched by any other brand. I too, would get many compliments. I will use it again. Please, please bring back the old formula. Do you have an ETA"
21382,1,Positive,I've been using Nexxus Exxtra gel (old formula) for 15 yrs and it was amazing. I realized that the product composition changed when the new formula came out and it is such a great disappointment!!!!! The new formula does not HOLD my hair in place whatsoever... What a waste of a product.... I'm so upset that you did this... WHY Can anyone out there recommend an alternative product.... Oscar
21383,1,Positive,"I have used Nexxus Exxtra Gel for years and have loved its ability to hold my hair in place. But the formula for the gel recently changed and it is more like water now than gel. I can't believe that they call it Exxtra hold, because it barely holds my hair in place and I need to use a lot of it. I hope someone reads this and pays attention. If something doesn't change I will not be using it any longer."
21384,1,Positive,"I bought this gel that I have been using for over 15 years on my curly hair. OMGosh!! The formula changed!!! My curls were no longer bouncy and the smell of the gel was over powering. Gave me a headache. The old Exxtra hair gel made my hair look amazing. The new Exxtra hair gel gave me a bad hair day!! Now, I have to spend a ton of money looking for a new gel. Bring back the old product, please, please!!!"
21385,1,Positive,"I have been using this product for over 10 yrs. I have thick, curly hair and seems like this WAS the only gel that worked. I have three bottles at home of the new packaging but it seems not only did you change the packaging but you changed the gel. It does not hold my hair at all and doesn't even feel like I have gel in. I will be returning my unopened bottles and will be looking for a new gel to use!!!"
21387,1,Positive,This is the first time I have ever written a review on a product. I have been one of your most loyal customers of the the extra gel for the past 15 years. Now you changed packaging and the product. It has made my curl hair so frizzy. I have maintained loyality when you jacked up the pricing over the years because it was the best product. I have Shared my product with my friends I talk about your product. I do not like the new look or product. Please change it back! If I had a choice I wouldn't even put one star next to the review!!
21389,1,Positive,"My husband and I have used the Exxtra gel for many years. I have very thick hair and it has always been the best and controlling it. However, since the change (now in this bronze looking package) the product has also changed. It doesn't hold as well as the former product, and the scent is too strong. Very, very unhappy customers. We have been forced to try other products (can't take the smell of this product all day). Thus far, we have been unsuccessful - but Pantene seems to be the closest to the former Nexxus Gel we so loved."
21390,1,Positive,"I have used your gel for many years and have loved it. But this formula along with the unbelievably strong, bordering on obnoxious fragrance. The new gel formula does not hold as well or for as long and the strong fragrance gave me a headache. I will never use your gel again and so very disappointed in a company that would change their product for what looks like change for changes sake. I see in other reviews you ask the person to call you. I have said all I want to say. Silly response from a well known and respected company."
21391,1,Positive,"Bad Move Nexxus. I have been using Nexxus shampoo and styling gel for 27 years. Now all of a sudden you decide to change your Nexxus Exxtra Gel. when you change a product you should make it better NOT worse! It does not hold as well and the new fragrance is overpowering. bring back the old formula! A piece of advise from one business person to another: When you have a very good product that people like, DON'T change it. Don't try to fix something that isn't broken. Thank you for forcing me to search for a replacement brand!"
21392,1,Positive,"I can no longer find the original Exxtra Gel - Superior Hold gel that I've been using for years, so I did try your new formula. I do not like it. I returned it. I find that the new formula does not hold as well as the original, and the new scent is way too strong! From your responses to the other disappointed reviews, I'm guessing that you will suggest I call your customer service number, which I will, but will Nexxus consider bringing the original formula back"
21393,1,Positive,"I have naturally curly hair and finally found a wonderful product with the Nexxus Exxtra Gel many, many years ago. Recently, the formula has changed and the hold is terrible!! My hair is a mess and the gel offers no help. PLEASE bring back the old gel formula!!"
21394,1,Positive,"I've been using the old formula for 30+ years. It was awesome. Bring it back! Meanwhile, I'm switching to another brand."
21397,1,Positive,"My husband has been using this gel for at least 15 years. A few weeks ago when I went to buy him a few new bottles (I always buy at least 3 at a time) I could no longer find it. I finally bought him the new gold bottle and hoped it would work. Well, after 3 weeks using it he said there was no way he could continue with it. He gave it a fair try but said he hates everything about it. The consistency, the smell, and most importantly it doesn't hold. Guess, we will start at square one and began testing gels."
21399,1,Positive,I've been using Nexxus Exxtra Gel for 30 years and loved the old formula because it provided great hold for my straight hair and was fragrance-free (at least to my sense of smell.) The new formula provides no hold and the scent gives me terrible headaches. Please bring back the old formula! Thank you.
21400,1,Positive,I've used the old formula for as long as I can remember and loved it. This new stuff just doesn't come close. Change it back please
21401,1,Positive,"I am so disappointed with the new gel. Why did you change the old gel I was a loyal customer for ten years at least. I recommended this product to so many people. I have thick, curly and frizzy hair, and this stuff was the BEST product. Also there was no strong scent. Now I am at a total loss. I cannot imagine that anyone is happy with the change and the scent is horrible. If people want a strong scent they should wear perfume, not get the smell in their hair gel. Why did you change it"
21402,1,Positive,"I have been using this gel for over 10 years and I hate the new formula!!! I, like many of the other reviewers, are very unhappy with the new smell and way this product works. The smell is soooo strong and not in a good way!! My hair is so greasy now and my curls look horrible!! I've been spending all morning online researching new hair gel because I really don't want to use this new Nexxus gel any longer ( I'm really bummed out with this new change!!! Bring back the old gel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
21403,1,Positive,"I have been using your sculpting gel for quite a few years now and found it really made a difference for my straight hair to hold a style. This new formulation in the pinkish bronze tube does nothing at all, has no hold to it. I do not recommend it for any hair type. So why did you change your formula, Nexxus"
21404,1,Positive,I loved the old formula and used it every day. Tried to use the new one and tossed it after a couple of times. It's so bad for my hair type that I couldn't even finish the tube! I won't buy anymore Nexxus products unless the old formula or something similar comes back.
21405,1,Positive,"This new formula of gel is terrible! The smell is too strong, and it dries my hair out! The old formula was fantastic! Bring it back! I have long naturally curly hair, and the old gel worked perfectly to keep away the frizz. It made my curls defined and my hair looked wonderful! It's hard finding just the right product, and the new gel isn't it. Please bring back the previous formula!!!!"
21406,1,Positive,I have been using this gel for a long time and finally found a gel that works great with my curly hair. You recently changed the formula and the scent and it is not the same. I have more fly aways in my hair than ever before.Now I have to find a new gel.The name of the gel is the same but NOT the product....Please Please bring back the old version. Why change something that works just fine
21409,1,Positive,"I am so sad that nexxus changed their extragel. I have been using this gel for approx 10 years, it is the ONLY gel I've used because it was so awesome. This new product is awful. It smells gross, feels sticky and cheap and just plain does not work - at all. I have no idea how I'm going to find a new product that works as well as the old extragel. Please nexxus, bring back the original extra gel!!"
21410,1,Positive,"I loved the Nexxus Exxtra Gel Superior Hold Sculpting gel in the light bronze tube. I guess it's discontinued because I can't find it any more. Bought the peach colored tube that sounded like the same product, but the fragrance is horrible (Blue Waltz cologne) and the product left my hair sticky. Now I've got to find another product because this one will be leaving with the trash tomorrow."
21411,1,Positive,"As I'm sure you know by now, and comments by your company indicate, you will be bringing back the old formula because the vast majority of folks thinks your new version is terrible and unless this is changes soon, you will loose decades old customers including myself. My question is when should we see this--You need to get on it and make this happen very quickly."
21415,1,Positive,Please bring the old product back. I used it for decades and loved it
21417,1,Positive,"I just bought the new formula, new packaged, Extra Gel. It HAS TOO MUCH PERFUME! There is a cloud of perfume odor around my head, all day. Ugh. I have been using this product for 25 years because is holds curls great, and did not have a strong perfume. Why did you change it Please take the perfume out! Don't buy this new version unless you want people to smell you before you arrive."
21418,1,Positive,The old formula held your hair much better and it didn't have such an overpowering scent. My hair is thick and coarse and the old formula was the only thing that worked to keep my hair in place. The new formula doesn't work for me and my Dr. says He can't handle the smell. I'm not to happy about it either. Bring back the old formula with a different name. Maybe exxtra gel 2
21419,1,Positive,"I have been using the Nexxus EXXtra Gel since the late 80's. So I am used to new packaging and looks. However, this time you have absolutely destroyed a great product. The hold isn't as good, and the smell. Yes I said smell, not fragrance. It smelled like I had a salon following me around all day. I couldn't wait to get home from work and get it out of my hair. Thanks for nothing!!"
21420,1,Positive,"Change for the better is always appreciated..........in this case,....it failed miserably!!! The new formula along with its new scent misses the mark completely. You have changed the product so dramatically that it's not anywhere near the same caliber of product that it replaces. Please have this new product re-evaluated and return it to its original formula without the new scent."
21421,1,Positive,"I have used this gel for many years and was super sad to see the new formula. I have given it a chance and used it for 2 weeks trying to see if I could use more, add mousse, dry it less, or anything to get the same results as I did with the old formula. All to no avail. My hair is frizzy by lunch time, it doesn't hold a good shape, and it just doesn't do the job . I can even overlook the smell if it held decently. Please bring the old stuff back! Until then, I am on the hunt for a new gel."
21424,1,Positive,"I called nexxus when I bought the new gel and let them know the old formula is the only gel that has ever worked in my hair. I Have very long thick curly hair and use 4 bottles a month , I went out and searched every store for all the old bottles left on the shelves at home Ievery store that carried it. I am now looking for something different to start using. Unless you put the old stuff back I will never buy nexxus products again. Really hoping to see it back ."
21427,1,Positive,"Please bring back the old gel formula!!! This new gel is terrible, makes the hair dry like straw with no holding power and no SHINE to the hair!! Why in the world would you have changed such a good product. The scent is over powering as well!! Please bring the old gel back, it was the only gel ever that worked for me and by the sounds of it many others. Now I have to go find another gel and it will be very hard to compare with it. Please reconsider and bring back the old gel!!!"
21429,1,Positive,"I have been using this product for a few years now and absolutely loved it. I went to the store to purchase more and found a different colored tube, I thought maybe you just changed the package look so I bought it. I went to use the new one a few days later and the smell is God awful!!! That was one of the main reasons why I had loved it because it didn't have a scent PLUS I just loved how it worked in my hair. Now what Really disgusted. Please bring back the old formula!!!"
21430,1,Positive,"The original version was a wonderful, dependable product I have used for many, many years and was taken off the market and changed for no good reason when it worked so well. It has a repulsive fragrance and is more watery. I actually had to rewash my hair 30 minutes after using it because I could not bear the fragrance. Extremely disappointed and don't know what I will do now after all these years using the Exxtra Gel as it previously was marketed."
21431,1,Positive,I have been using Exxtra gel for more than 20 years and have been extremely happy with it. However this new formula has very little hold and I hate the strong smell. Why would you change a great thing Please bring back the old formula that deserves the name Exxtra.
21433,1,Positive,"As other customers have indicated, the new formula is of far inferior quality compared to the previous version. I read on this page that there will be an adjustment to return to a tweaked version of the older formula. Can you provide a time frame for this I have been a loyal customer for a decade, and I really abhor the idea of having to test other brands to find a replacement."
21434,1,Positive,"I loved the old product, so much so that I paid the overpriced cost. It was perfect. This new product New York Salon Care is nowhere near as effective at keeping my very fine hair full of body. I am very frustrated that I bought the new product expecting it to be of the same quality. The fragrance has even changed for the worse. Please, bring back the old product or tell me where I can purchase your old inventory. Thank you for letting me provide my feedback."
21435,1,Positive,So disappointed in the new formula. It gives my fine and body less hair no hold and leaves my hair filmy and flat. This product no longer works well when using a curling or flat iron. I want the old formula back. Why change a product that has worked great for years. So disappointed I bought two tubes of this as I didn't ever want to run out of the original product. I will be looking for something else. Please email me if you change the formula back to the original.
21437,1,Positive,"The new gel is no where near as good as the old gel. Perhaps its a financial decision to dilute the old gel and get 1.3 -1.5 more bottles out of one of the old thereby generating more revenue, OR perhaps its about a need for a new product yet not offering a market test Either way they DO need to bring the old one back. IN the alternative maybe Nexxus can offer the old gel for sale Online ONLY and see what the consumer preference is"
21438,1,Positive,Used the original product for many years. I've tried the new version for several months and am giving up to look for an alternative. Really wish the old version could be revived or at least an explanation offered for the change. This no longer qualifies as an Extra Hold product in my book.
21439,1,Positive,"The new formula is a weaker, runnier gel. But the bigger problem is the scent! It's way too perfumed. After only 10 minutes it's giving me a headache. I'll be switching to ANYTHING else starting tomorrow. I've been using Nexxus gel for about 14 years. Between it's previous strength and previous non-offending scent it is unacceptable to not offer the original product any longer."
21440,1,Positive,The old formula was great. This product sucks. Bring back the old formula.
21441,1,Positive,"I loved the old formulation of this product. It was absolutely perfect. The shine, the stylability, the glossy, shiney finish. This newer version is stickier to work with, has a duller finish and the fragrance is more perfumey now instead of the previous cleaner, fresher scent. I am so disappointed that you discontinued making the other earlier - more perfect gel."
21442,1,Positive,"I do not know why you changed your extra gel, but it is not the same as the old kind with the other bottle. I have EXTREMELY curly hair and I used that for over 10 years and you all of a sudden you change it!!!!! Please bring it back. The new kind does NOT hold like the other!!!!!I am lost without it!!!!!!"
21444,1,Positive,Nexxus should not have changed their packaging or their ingredients. I am really bummed about it. I have been using this product for a really long time and for them to change it doesn't make sense. So Many people loved this product but are now finding something else to use instead. I hope they go back to the original product.
21449,1,Positive,"I've used Nexxus Extra Gel since 1984. The recent change in the product is more than disappointing. It is not as thick as the longstanding version, is heavily scented, does not last as long or wash out as easily. The previous version is the best I have ever used, it is a shame they felt they needed to tinker with it. So long to a loyal 30+ year customer!"
21451,1,Positive,Why in the world would a company change the formula of a perfect styling product that has worked for me for 15+ years to a scent that smells like baby oil/powder It just completely floors me that Nexxus would think adults want to smell like that Thank goodness I was able to return it to the store I purchased it from. I wouldn't even give it away to someone.
21453,1,Positive,"Please please please bring back the old formula styling gel!! I've used your gel for over 20 yrs, absolutely loved it!! This new formula is terrible, weighs down my hair and makes it feel straw like. No other product could ever compete with the old formula. You love making hair beautiful, you will not do it with this new gel. Please reconsider, bring it back!!!"
21454,1,Positive,Been using the old product for years and hands down best on the market. The new product is terrible and feels like you added slime to your hair. The old product was awesome and worked well. After application it dried and the hold was awesome and no flaking. Please discontinue the new product and go back to the old!!
21455,1,Positive,"I have used the old formula since 2003 and I was super happy with it. The new one is so bad and doesn't hold my hair. I had to start searching for different brands. If you don't want to loose all your consumers , bring the old gel back !!!!"
21456,1,Positive,"As others have stated, I've used this product for many years and was so happy that it was affordable and did what it said it would. I have very fine thin hair and this was just the ticket for getting some texture and hold. Why do companies have to fix what ain't broke I can only assume it has to do with cheaper ingredients. This makes me sad!"
21457,1,Positive,"I'm biracial (black and white) and every biracial person's hair is slightly different from the next biracial person's. Unlike a lot of black and and white biracial people I know, I can't use products like Carol's Daughter and Mixed Chicks. For years, literally years, I searched high and low and low for a product that would tame my mane. I finally found the Exxte Gel and it was like the hair gods smiled on me. Perfect is an understatement. It kept my normally super frizzy, over-the-top-puffy hair tame, smooth, shinny, and appropriately volumized. Additionally, I could get two or three days worth of style put of one application which was AMAZING because before the Exxtra Gel, I'd spend a crazy amount of time wrestling my hair into a tight bun. BUT that was before the formula change. WHAT HAPPENED. Now the gel feels more alcohol or water based. I have to use three times as much. It flakes. I have to rinse it out everyday. It smells weird. It leaves weird dry, frizzy patches. In no way are blow dryers welcome with this new formula. I don't know why Nexxus ruined a wonderful thing that didn't need to be fixed. PLEASE BRING BACK THE LAST FORMULA. P.S. The new branding is beautiful. The sort of rose gold color is really nice....but the formula has to be reverted."
21458,1,Positive,"I've used Nexxus Exxtra Gel for many years and until the recent change to this product would have given it an excellent rating..........but not now!!! I've always kept an ample supply of Exxtra Gel (for personal use) but once in the past several years I ran out and was unable to purchase any for a couple of weeks. I purchased a product of lesser quality for a lesser price just to get by. Well, the NEW Nexxus Exxtra Gel is the same product as the cheaper, thinner, WAY less superior product that I purchased as a get by replacement. I won't mention the name or the maker of the product.......but it's like you filled an Exxtra Gel tube with their gel. I am VERY disappointed. I will be shopping for a better product."
21460,1,Positive,The old product was one of the best on the market. This product does not have many of the ingredients that helped build volume while smoothing. Nexxus really missed the boat on this one. Creating a product with fragrance seemed to be a priority over creating a product that delivers results.
21461,1,Positive,"I have been using the old formula for years with my thick natural curly hair. I loved how it kept frizz under control in the worst HOT humid weather. It held the curl so nicely without the sticky, heavy feel. It was the best stuff on the market! I have no idea why Nexxus would change the product. Why not just create a new line If you don't have curly hair, you have no idea how difficult it is to find a winner of a product to keep hair natural and at it's best. I am soooo unhappy with the hold and the smell in the new formula. Please, please, please bring back the old formula. I am desperately buying up all old product I can find and don't know what I will do when my supply is gone."
21462,1,Positive,Not an effective gel when compared to Versastyler and Omnistyler.
21463,1,Positive,"Like most others with curly hair it's near impossible to find the perfect product or combination of products to control the frizz and not kill your curl. The old version was awesome, smelled good and worked great with only small amounts needed. Who in the world changed it Did you use a focus group of actual customers The new product is terrible, doesn't do anything for my hair, is thin and smells terrible (like an old lady coming from the beauty parlor). For the love of all that's right, change it back PLEASE!!! 240 out of 270 reviewers hate it, I can't think of a better reason to go back to the original! Listen to your loyal customers Nexxus, or you'll lose them."
21464,1,Positive,"Just discovered that the gel I have used successfully for years is no longer available and the replacement contains a preservative - polyquaternium, to which I am allergic. This happened with a previous product I used. The formula was changed and I wondered why my face was turning red and itchy. After visits to the dermatologist I discovered quaternium was the culprit. There are surprising few hair products without this substance. Very disappointed that Nexxus has discontinued a perfectly good product - why"
21465,1,Positive,"Nexxus XXtra Gel formula was changed with NO NOTICE to the consumer (label is exactly the same although the tube color is different). The change is terrible! The product comes out of the tube as a soft Jello instead of a styling gel as before. It won't stick to your fingers for applying, and after styling and drying exactly as done with the old formula, my hair is limp instead of firmly styled. The next time I tried using more product and my hair became a sticky, gluey mess that I had to immediately wash off! This product should have been labeled NEW FORMULA to warn customers - or better yet, IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CHANGED IN THE FIRST PLACE!!"
21467,1,Positive,"I have probably been using Nexxus extra hold for a good 25 years. My favorite was when we could purchase the product in the pump which has been gone for some time now. Recently, I went to buy the renamed exxtra superior hold only to find out the product is discontinued What happened to my good old Nexxus Exxtra Hold gel that gave my hair the wet look and incredible hold The new gel is so potent in smell and just does not offer the same quality that I have become accustom to over the past few decades. Unfortunately it is time to look for an alternate product as the new regime of Nexxus gel's are no longer meeting my needs."
21469,1,Positive,"I have used the original Nexxus Exxtra Gel product for years. I absolutely loved it, it was the best hair gel on the market by far. I have curly hair and have tried everything out there, but there was no comparison. I can not understand why Nexxus would change their Gel formula. It is now by far the worst hair gel I have every used, so now it's back to finding something new. I beg Nexxus to bring their original formula back! I can't imaging why they wouldn't seeing that mostly all those that reviewed it feel the same. Also I don't think I have ever written a review about anything but because I was so disappointed I felt I had to! :("
21472,1,Positive,"I have been using Nexxus Extra Gel since the 80's....back when it was sold in salons. I have course, thick, curly hair and am also a professional hair stylist. I have tried tons of professional gels over the years and never found one that kept my curls nice and controlled fritz the way the OLD NEXXUS FORMULA did. The new formula is HORRIBLE!!! My hair is lifeless, frizzy and dull. I have also noticed my scalp itches quite a bit which I have never experienced before, but am unsure if the new formula could be causing it or not. PLEASE! Go back to the old formula! You had a great product for thick, curly hair! Most gels out there are so watery and are not compatible with that hair type. So many companies cater to normal or fine hair types, it is ridiculous. After reading so many of the reviews I am hoping you honor your loyal customers requests and go back to the old formula! If you want to change anything on the old formula you could change the scent... it smells more masculine. A more sweet, fresh scent would be nice.... but using the old formula!"
21474,1,Positive,A couple years ago I tried the Nexxus Exxtra Gel and it was the best gel I had ever used. I was an instant fan and became a loyal customer of this and some of the other Nexxus products. I would brag about Nexxus anytime a stylist asked me to try something different. Unfortunately I'm no longer a fan after having bought two bottles of the newly formulated Nexxus Exxtra Gel. The new formula is now the worst gel I have ever used and I'm upset that the new prettier packaging didn't bother to advertise they changed the formula. I bought the first bottle and thought someone must have tampered with it because it smelled like baby oil. when I bought the second bottle I realized that the formula really had been changed to one that seemed watered down and cheap. It has turned me away from the Nexxus product line I once bragged about and my stylists are happy that I'm buying different brands from them again.
21475,1,Positive,Received a free sample of the newer formula. The smell is not as bad as the previous new formula. The hold is still not up to par the with the old formula that we are all used to. The newer formula also flakes. Please bring back the old formula. Why would you mess with something that everyone has loved for the past 20+ years
21476,1,Positive,Almost as bad as the Old New formula! Only difference is the scent is gone. Still not the great hold of the Old Old formula. Don't waste your money.
21478,1,Positive,"Was disappointed when tried to purchase the usual Exxtra gel and saw they were out. I finally found it but noticed the packaging was different. Much to my surprise I found that they had changed the formula. I gave it a try and immediately notice that this was definitely not the same, nor was as good. First was the fragrance, the old had little to no smell to it, but this new one had too strong a smell. I don't want my hair product to have a scent, that is what cologne is for. My wife immediately commented to me that the scent bothered her. The next issue is that the feel, hold and and styling was not as good as before. It make my hair my hair feel soft after, but so did the original. Bottom line is I don't think this is as good a product as the original. Please bring the original formula back and soon. I loved the old product much better!"
21479,1,Positive,"I have naturally curly hair. The old formula was the right mix for my curls. It tamed the frizz, wasn't too heavy and smelled good. The new formula reeks, and I may as well use motor oil on it. It looks worse after I put it on. Please bring back the old one. I have dozens of bottles of gels I have tried in my cabinet that just doesn't compare."
21480,1,Positive,"I have been using this sculpting gel for over 10 years and have always gotten compliments on how great my thick curly hair was. Strangers would literally stop me to compliment me on my hair and ask what products I use. I would ALWAYS reccomend Nexxus super hold sculpting gel as my must have product. Unfortunately, the formula has been changed and the new one is no where near the original. Since then, I have tried loads of other gels from ridiculously priced high end to drug store specials and have come up disappointed with all of them. Nothing is like the original sculpting gel. Apparently after seeing the overall response to this product, I am clearly not alone on this. I have a tiny bit left of the old formula that I use sparingly for special occasions, this is pathetic lol!! Please bring the old formula back!!!"
21483,1,Positive,"2 out of 5 stars. Donald 2 months ago YOU CHANGED THE FORMULA.....NOT GOOD! Dear Nexxus: I have used your Exxtra Gel, Superior Hold for several years, sold in the tan colored tube. Within the last 6 months or so, the packaging has changed to the copper colored tube, and the gel is different as well. It is less thick and does not hold as well. I was in a store recently and managed to find the older version. It reaffirms my contention that this new formula is not as effective as the old one. Please bring it back!!! Yes, I recommend this product. Review photo 1 Photo This action will open a modal dialog.

Were happy to note that we are tweaking the product and will have the improved/restored formulation back shortly."
21486,1,Positive,"I used the old formula for more than 10 years and it was perfect. I have very long (below my waist) natural curly hair and live in humid Florida. I have tried many products but nothing ever came close to the original formula of Nexxus Exxtra Gel. The original formula had the right amount of hold, didn't dry my hair, it actually felt moisturized, no flakes, no crunch and it controlled frizz. I loved it! It's all I needed, no spray, mousse, leave-in... nothing else! I recommended it to anyone that ask what I used. Why change it! The new formula is as horrible as it smells, if not worse. My hair feels horrible and it doesn't control frizz at all. Now I find myself searching for a new product all over again. Please bring back the previous formula!"
21487,1,Positive,"Never gave much thought about what I used to keep my hair in place over the years, I just used what my wife had around the house, as long as it wasn't greasy or smelly. So now on my own, as a widow, I used up what was always around over several years. I don't use much. Finally I had to replace the Nexxus Styling Gel, Pure Control Stylizer. I tried the revised Nexxus replacement product and had to throw it out. It was too greasy feeling and the smell was just to much. I hope you do bring back the prior formula, I haven't found a replacement, and one never knows what is missed until it isn't around anymore. And yes for me, this is a good problem to have most of my hair to deal with in my 70's. thx"
21488,1,Positive,"The new Exxtra Gel formula is awful. The old formula was by far the best offered in the market in terms of providing an extra long-lasting hold along with a wet look when desired. The new formula provides zero utility and smells offensive to boot with an undeniably far more powerful fragrance. PLEASE bring the old formula back. I saw Nexus responding in posts last month that an improved/restored formulation will be offered shortly. I really hope this comes to fruition. Although no competitor products I have recently tried come close to measuring up to the original formula, several are indeed superior to your new offering and will unfortunately become my go-to once my current supply of old Exxtra Gel is gone."
21490,1,Positive,"The new formula is terrible...so oily and slick feeling!! Please go back to the old formula..I love the product, but have had to look else where to find something that compares to the old extra gel!!"
21492,1,Positive,"I loved the original formula. My hair was moisturized and shiny when I used it, most importantly the hold was firm but not crunchy. I used the new formula thinking that the bottle was redesigned. I noticed a difference in the formula too when my hair started to frizz. The scent was too much to bear and there was flaking!!! I never experienced flaking with this gel before. Now I must find a new gel or make my own flax seed gel."
21494,1,Positive,"I have been using your product for many years, I have very thick course hair, the old formula was the only product that would hold my hair in place (all day). It also allowed me to have the wet or dry look and the smell of the gel was great! I tried the new formula and I could not wait to get home from my night out the wash the gel out of my hair, the smell was AWFUL! Please listen to your core customers and bring back the old formula! Please!!!"
21495,1,Positive,"I agree with all the other reviewers. We all probably started using the Exxtra Gel because the others didn't hold as well. The new formula is like the other gels that just don't hold. To make it even worse, they added a fragrance that smells like you are constantly breathing in hairspray. If I try to use more gel to get more hold, it is difficult to breathe because of the fragrance. I'm not exagerating. Please bring back an Exxtra Classic version."
21496,1,Positive,"I am in total agreement. I have been using this product for over 20 years. The new formula is watery, has no hold and is too fragrant. I can live with the fragrance but I cannot live with the lack of performance. I do hope they reconsider and go back to the old formula or at least a mix of the 2. As far as im concerned, this product is useless for my hair type. Hoping to find a replacement. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated :)"
21498,1,Positive,Please bring back the old formula. Several women in my household used it for decades and it worked on every hair type.
21500,1,Positive,"I'm a little late to the party, but like many others have been very disappointed with the new formula for the Exxtra Gel. I had used the older formula for 5-10 years and was very happy with it. The new version has a heavy scent and doesn't hold my hairstyle as well. I'm using it only because it is time consuming and expensive to find a replacement. Would much prefer the old formula be reintroduced."
21502,1,Positive,"old formula was such a great product, not sure why it needed to be changed. Please bring the old formula back."
21503,1,Positive,"If you bring back the old formula, I can GUARANTEE/PROMISE you, Nexxus, that I will buy YOUR hair gel, and NOBODY else's. The old formula was the BEST on the market ...period. As long as you sell it, I will buy it. I will not buy this new formula again, once was enough. Please bring the old formula back."
21505,1,Positive,I loved the old Exxtra Gel. I used it for years and have always feared that I wouldn't be able to find it. It held my hair in place exactly as I desired all day. This new formula has an overwhelming smell. And it holds your hair for about 15 minutes. I may as well put water through my hair. I have read review after review on this new formula which agree with me. Please go back to the original formula. Nexxus has lost my business.
21506,1,Positive,I totally agree with the hundreds of others who are extremely dissatisfied with the new formula and smell of what used to be the best hair gel on the market. I have been using this gel for 30+ years so why change it now! Nothing works like this one did. Please go back to the old formula!!! And please get rid of the horrid smell!
21507,1,Positive,My husband and sons have used the old gel for the last 10 years and it is the only product that has worked for their style and hair texture. They are extremely particular about their hair and it has worked for all 3 of them - in addition to the many I have spent over the years on it. The new formula smells AWFUL my hubby is constantly complaining his head now itches ..... PLEASE bring back the old formula - NEXXUS - I do not think you did well on your market research - men use this product and do not want to smell like a rose ... If you do not plan - can you let us know where to buy the original non scented formula.
21508,1,Positive,"I have used Exxtra Gel since 1988 and it WAS the best gel on the market until earlier in 2015 when you made the mistake of re-formulating it. It is thinner in consistency and doesn't hold nearly as well as the previous formula. Now about the new scent, it is the most horrible smell you could have ever invented! Consider the fact that just as many men use your gel as women do, besides you don't need to add fragrance to styling gel. Men use cologne and women perfume. I have been using gel from one of your competitors, but if you restore your exxtra gel to the previous formula I will return to Nexxus."
21509,1,Positive,I have used Exxtra Gel for about 20 years. I don't know why you changed a product that was superior from every other gel on the market. The new scent is irritating to my eyes and the hold is not as strong. I have very thick and curly hair and nothing was better than the old Exxtra Gel. I used to get compliments on my curls all the time and friends would always ask me what gel I was using because my hair looked so amazing. This gel is not doing the job and I'm looking for alternatives. It looks like I am not the only one that is upset here. Please reconsider bringing back the Exxtra Gel that we all love! Please!
21514,1,Positive,"I have been using Nexxus products for a long time. I have long curly hair and finding the right product makes my life easier. For years I've used the Exxtra gel... I've sent so many people to the product. Recently I noticed a package change (which I think looks great). However it's not only a package change, the gel itself is completely different. It's not remotely close to what it was. The hold is weak, my curls frizz... even the application is difficult.. the gel clumps up while putting it on. My only hope is Nexxus will change back! I'm now on the hunt to find a new gel that works."
21515,1,Positive,"I have also used only Nexxus products for the last 20 years for all my hair care needs (I.e. Therappe, Diametress, Humectress etc.) including Exxtra Gel but sadly I am extremely disappointed with the new formula. I am OK with the smell but nothing more. It does NOT hold my curly hair at all, as a matter of fact it feels like watery alcohol. I am dreading going on a hunt to find a new gel that will hold my hair like your old formula but sadly will have to. I think it would be a good idea to take into account just how many long time users are complaint about your new formula. :("
21517,1,Positive,"Instead of asking me to contact customer service (unless you have a secret back stock of the old formula) please explain why you changed a product that worked well. I can only assume it's cheaper to produce this watery mess. This stuff doesn't hold anything. The search begins unless you can tell us when you plan to bring back the old. Even Coke admitted their error and they seem to be doing ok. It's obvious to all (and hopefully you by now) that this stuff is junk so the sooner you cut your losses, the less time loyal customers will have to find a permanent replacement."
21518,1,Positive,"I have used Nexxus EXXTRA Gel for years, but it is time to find a new gel if you don't bring back the original formula. I don't like the smell of the new formula and it doesn't hold as well as the old formula. Not to mention, the old formula was the only gel I have been able to find that I was able to get it wet and style my hair again later in the day. I won't buy another Nexxus product if this new formula is all you are going to sell going forward. And I only gave 1 star because you have to select at least one."
21519,1,Positive,"I have been a loyal user of Nexxus Exxtra Gel for 20+ years. I loved it!! I would get compliments on my hair all the time and I have recommended it many times over the years. Nexxus, why did you change a good thing!! The new formula is thinner, has dried out my hair, does not control frizz at all and smells horribly like rubbing alcohol. I feel like I am using hand sanitizer on my hair!! Sadly, I am desperately searching for a new product to use on my hair. The only way I would purchase this product again is if you brought back your old formula."
21521,1,Positive,"Like most other people on this thread, I too have been using this gel for years and it was the most perfect thing for my super curly, super thick hair. No other product has ever even come close to it. WHY, OH WHY would you go and change it! It's AWFUL now! It smells horrible, it's so thin and watery feeling on my hair and my hair is a frizzy mess once it dries with this gel in in. The old gel formula used to keep my curls beautiful, together and soft for at least two days! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, I'm begging you to bring back the old formula!"
21523,1,Positive,"I have always used used Nexxus products the Exxtra gel for over 20 years. I always loved the way it used to smell hold, so nice to the touch so fragrant to the nose. Why change something that's already perfect Please bring back the old formula there is nothing else available like it. I have resorted to buying out old stock thru ebay as this was a big part of my daily regimen sadly its gone now...The new Professional version is not the same the scent is overpowering like an old ladies perfume. -PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL"
21524,1,Positive,"I have used the NEXXUS Extra Hold Gel for years (black cap). The replacement product in the platinum tube is a different formula and not nearly as effective - hold, and sheen. Will the old formula be available I am unable to find a suitable replacement."
21525,1,Positive,When Nexxus reformulated the new formula I had hopes that they had heard their customers. Unfortunately they fell short again with their reformulated new product. I have been using their gel for years. It was excellent in every way. I just don't get it. Simply bring back the old formula. It would make many loyal customers VERY happy.
21526,1,Positive,Why change a product I have been buying and completely loyal to for something like 20 years. Please rush back the old formula. Can you not see the overwhelmingly poor ratings of the new formula Nothing else I have found has low fragrance and good hold. This is the New Coke of Nexxus.
21527,1,Positive,"Ive been using the EEXTRA GEL SUPERIOR HOLD Sculpting Gel for four years and loved it. When I got the new one I thought maybe it is just a new tube color but to my disappointment it was a completely new and definitely NOT improved product. I have thick dry curly hair and the original product made it look so nice and natural. I was always stopped by other curley women who wanted to know my secret. I would apply it on wet hair and twirl my curls. Once dried, the hair wasnt stiff like in other products and it really looked great for at least two days. The new products is hard to apply it doesnt sculpt and stays frizzy. I have to use a lot more to maintain some shape to the curls. Once it dries, my curls feel stiff and they look dead and lackluster. I am so disappointed. Why did Nexus feel the need to change a good product I loved it. I didnt even mention the yucky smell because that is the least of my problems. I wont continue using this product that is for sure."
21528,1,Positive,"I have loved the Exxtra gel for about a decade, and I could sense that a change was coming with this gel quite some time ago. I thought it was being totally discontinued, so I rounded up every bottle I could find in the tan packaging and stock piled them. I was relieved to see Nexxus had released Exxtra gel in a shiny new package, and I promptly bought a few bottles online. My happiness changed forever when I realized that more than just the packaging had changed. Where had my beloved Exxtra gel gone The new formula does nothing for my frizz and curls, and to make matters worse the new scent is so overpowering! Nexxus should have specified on the packaging new formula when this was re-released...It is not the same gel, yet it boasts the same name. I will never buy this product again. I am now saving the rest of my tan Exxtra gel bottles for special occasions, and I'm now on the search for a new gel product all together. Such a shame."
21529,1,Positive,"I have always been a huge fan and advocate for Nessux gel and have been using it for more than 10 years. The New Formula has been a huge disappointment! I like the fact that it was a bit thicker and the scent is great, but the performance is far from the standard that the original Nexxus gel had set many years ago. The New Formula doesn't hold like it used to. After 2 hours my hair started losing its shape and style. The worst part of the New Formula is it flakes! I always love Nexxus gel for its ability to keep its shape through out the day and flake free! I remember days when I used to slept with Nexxus gel in my hair and woke up the next day, impress with how it still retain the shape of my hair without any flakes. I am writing this review to show how disappointed I am with the New Formula. I don't see myself ever using this product again at this rate."
21530,1,Positive,"Like a lot of other customers posts about this product, I do not like the change. I too have used this gel for years and loved it. I was hooked the 1st time I tried it. My hair is thick and naturally curly. I deal with a fair amount of frizz, a daily ordeal and nothing has helped like.Nexxus Gel. Now, I put your gel in my hair and as my hair dries it starts to feel like glue. Once my hair is dry, along with the feel of glue my hair feels like straw. I can't run my hand through my hair. I used to be able to get up the day after I washed my hair and add more gel to control any frizz. Now with the new gel when I try to put more gel in my hair, my hair feels like a stiff gluey mess. Stiff as straw and impossible to comb, even with a wide tooth comb. There's no shine, totally dull and lifeless. I was mortified some one might try to touch my hair. Really gross. I washed it out of my hair and never used it again. I've got half a tube and a full tube sitting in my closet, not being used! Please bring back your old gel! PLEASE!!!! Thank you"
21531,1,Positive,"I am a few months away from turning 50 and started using Nexxus Exxtra gel when I entered the military at age 18!!! Nexus Exxtra gel has been my/the ONLY gel that I have used or would use in more than 30 years...though the packaging has changed over the past 30+ years, the formula has ALWAYS remained true until now. Beleive me, it was perfect and you really should go back!!! The ORIGINAL formula was a great consistency to apply, superior hold, no flaking when combed out and absolutely no heavy build up....even after several days of use....NONE! My hair has always been important to me and my one TRIED and TRUE gel has changed. PLEASE change back.... When something is perfect, you don't change....read the hundreds and soon to be thousands of other reviews on this change.... Everyone hates the new stuff. I'm a 30 year veteran of your original product and hate the new stuff....you know it's not the same as soon as you apply it in your hands!"
21532,1,Positive,When Nexxus reformulated the new formula I had hopes that they had heard their customers. Unfortunately they fell short again with their reformulated new product. I have been using their gel for years. It was excellent in every way. I just don't get it. Simply bring back the old formula. It would make many loyal customers VERY happy.
21536,1,Positive,Why change a product I have been buying and completely loyal to for something like 20 years. Please rush back the old formula. Can you not see the overwhelmingly poor ratings of the new formula Nothing else I have found has low fragrance and good hold. This is the New Coke of Nexxus.
21538,1,Positive,I have been using Nexxus Exxtra gel for over a decade...until you changed the formula and fragrance. The new gel formula does not hold as well and the fragrance is HORRENDOUS!!! Your former loyal customer
21539,1,Positive,I have been using exxtra gel since 2000. My hair is huge and frizzy. I have tried every product under the sun and exxtra gel is always the winner. Now you have changed the formula and I can see that most are not happy. Please change it back. Please and thank you
21540,1,Positive,"SO SAD THEY CHANGED THE FORMULA, LOVED IT THE WAY IT WAS."
21542,1,Positive,Used nexus for years. Formula changed now. Much too light.
21544,1,Positive,bring back the old gel and hairspray!!!! please!!! please!!!
21546,1,Positive,"Nexxus, why did you change the Exxtra Gel It is a watered down version (seriously...I believe with my whole heart that you added water to the gel) of the older, MUCH BETTER Exxtra Gel. It was perfect for my curly hair, and now I am struggling to find a gel that works as well as the old Exxtra Gel. As other reviewers wrote, the new gel also smells very bad. Did you test this product before changing it"
21547,1,Positive,Uhh it really does hurt my feelings that they have changed the product then put professional on the label as if the quality is better. It is soooo hardddd to find something that works great with your hair and when u lose it and have to start the search over its beyond frustrating. With the new formula my curl is the same as if i used a dollar store gel and it smells bad. Id rather yaw bring back the old formula and charge us a couple dollars more if need be.
21548,1,Positive,"I've been using this product for all long as I can remember. It was a somewhat thick gel, with an unnoticeable fragrance that worked great with my curly hair. Now with the newly formulated product, the gel is watery, chemical smelling, and doesn't do anything to help the frizz or control my curls at all. I will be returning this product to the store and looking for a new brand. Please bring back the old formula!! I've been a loyal Nexxus user for a very long time and it makes me sad to have to find another product to use on my hair!"
21551,1,Positive,"The container seam has split open on the last two purchases about 1/2 way through the product, making it messy and difficult to use. I hope you will be able to correct the problem it is a real inconvenience."
21553,1,Positive,"I've been using exxtra gel since it came out 18,19 years ago and with the change I will not purchase it again looking for a new hair gel as we speak."
21554,1,Positive,So disappointed in the new formula. It gives my fine and body less hair no hold and leaves my hair filmy and flat. This product no longer works well when using a curling or flat iron. I want the old formula back. Why change a product that has worked great for years. So disappointed I bought two tubes of this as I didn't ever want to run out of the original product. I will be looking for something else. Please email me if you change the formula back to the original.
21558,1,Positive,I have used this gel for 20 years and always loved it. They recently changed the formula including the scent and it's horrible. . The hold is different. It's not as good. PLEASE BRING THE OLD GEL BACK.
21559,1,Positive,"Why on earth did you change the formula of the Nexxus Salon Hair Care Exxtra Gel, Superior Hold Not only does the new reformulation not have the same strong holding capacity as the old product, the fragrance is obnoxious and too powerful. My coworkers are all complaining about the smell, and it's causing them to sneeze!"
21562,1,Positive,"I have been using this gel for over 10 yrs, i have curly hair and the old gel made my culrs look great, never frizzy. The new formula is terrible, i have lots of frizz and my scalp is itchy. I'm looking for a new product, if anyone finds a great one please post."
21563,1,Positive,Nexxus has clearly taken this product to an overpriced and over scented cheap hair gel. Everything about it is worse.
21564,1,Positive,"What a disappointment with my recent purchase of Exxtra Gel! The formula changed. The first and only day I used it, I sneezed and had a runny nose all day. The fragrance is overpowering. The hold is not as good either. Why did you mess with perfection"
21565,1,Positive,"I have been using Nexxus EXXTRA Gel for year. I just bought one and its not the same. New formula has a strong perfume scent and it just dried my hair. I loved the old Nexxus Exxtra Gel, not this new one. They should of changed the packaging only. gelfail"
21567,1,Positive,"I have been using this product for a few years now and absolutely loved it. I went to the store to purchase more and found a different colored tube, I thought maybe you just changed the package look so I bought it. I went to use the new one a few days later and the smell is God awful!!! That was one of the main reasons why I had loved it because it didn't have a scent PLUS I just loved how it worked in my hair. Now what Really disgusted. Please bring back the old formula!!!"
21572,1,Positive,"I have been using this gel for over 10 years and I hate the new formula!!! I, like many of the other reviewers, are very unhappy with the new smell and way this product works. The smell is soooo strong and not in a good way!! My hair is so greasy now and my curls look horrible!! I've been spending all morning online researching new hair gel because I really don't want to use this new Nexxus gel any longer ( I'm really bummed out with this new change!!! Bring back the old gel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
21573,1,Positive,I have used the Exxtra Gel product for well over 15 years. The recent change and new formula is thinned out (low viscosity) and now has a heavy hair spray scent. You guys ruined a really great product. Sadly I'm looking to buy up all the remaining old formal I can find and then when I run out I'll look else where.
21574,1,Positive,"I have been using this product for almost 20 years and love it for my curly hair. But since the formula changed, it does not hold the curls and leaves my hair frizzy by the end of the day. Please please bring back the old formula!!!"
21575,1,Positive,"I am so sad that nexxus changed their extragel. I have been using this gel for approx 10 years, it is the ONLY gel I've used because it was so awesome. This new product is awful. It smells gross, feels sticky and cheap and just plain does not work - at all. I have no idea how I'm going to find a new product that works as well as the old extragel. Please nexxus, bring back the original extra gel!!"
21579,1,Positive,"I have been using Nexxus products for a long time. I have long curly hair and finding the right product makes my life easier. For years I've used the Exxtra gel...

I'm now on the hunt to find a new gel that works."
21584,1,Positive,Not an effective gel when compared to Versastyler and Omnistyler.
21585,1,Positive,The old product was one of the best on the market. This product does not have many of the ingredients that helped build volume while smoothing. Nexxus really missed the boat on this one. Creating a product with fragrance seemed to be a priority over creating a product that delivers results.
21591,1,Positive,"I've been using the old formula for 30+ years. It was awesome. Bring it back! Meanwhile, I'm switching to another brand."
21593,1,Positive,I have been using Nexxus Exxtra Gel for YEARS and it was wonderful for my thick naturally curly hair. There was NO other product out there that worked as good as that one DID. I have tried just about every single brand and type of hair gel over the years and the old formula was the BEST. And since this change... I have yet to find any product that works to control my hair like the old product did. Why did you do this!! BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULA!!!!!
21594,1,Positive,I've used the old formula for as long as I can remember and loved it. This new stuff just doesn't come close. Change it back please
21596,1,Positive,"Just discovered that the gel I have used successfully for years is no longer available and the replacement contains a preservative - polyquaternium, to which I am allergic. This happened with a previous product I used. The formula was changed and I wondered why my face was turning red and itchy. After visits to the dermatologist I discovered quaternium was the culprit. There are surprising few hair products without this substance. Very disappointed that Nexxus has discontinued a perfectly good product - why"
21597,1,Positive,This new product doesn't hold and makes my hair frizzy.
21598,1,Positive,"I have naturally curly hair and finally found a wonderful product with the Nexxus Exxtra Gel many, many years ago. Recently, the formula has changed and the hold is terrible!! My hair is a mess and the gel offers no help. PLEASE bring back the old gel formula!!"
21599,1,Positive,Please bring back the old formula. Several women in my household used it for decades and it worked on every hair type.
21600,1,Positive,"old formula was such a great product, not sure why it needed to be changed. Please bring the old formula back."
21604,1,Positive,"The new formula is terrible...so oily and slick feeling!! Please go back to the old formula..I love the product, but have had to look else where to find something that compares to the old extra gel!!"
21607,1,Positive,The old formula was great. This product sucks. Bring back the old formula.
21608,1,Positive,I have been using Exxtra gel for more than 20 years and have been extremely happy with it. However this new formula has very little hold and I hate the strong smell. Why would you change a great thing Please bring back the old formula that deserves the name Exxtra.
21611,1,Positive,Used the original product for many years. I've tried the new version for several months and am giving up to look for an alternative. Really wish the old version could be revived or at least an explanation offered for the change. This no longer qualifies as an Extra Hold product in my book.
21612,1,Positive,"Never gave much thought about what I used to keep my hair in place over the years, I just used what my wife had around the house, as long as it wasn't greasy or smelly. So now on my own, as a widow, I used up what was always around over several years. I don't use much. Finally I had to replace the Nexxus Styling Gel, Pure Control Stylizer. I tried the revised Nexxus replacement product and had to throw it out. It was too greasy feeling and the smell was just to much. I hope you do bring back the prior formula, I haven't found a replacement, and one never knows what is missed until it isn't around anymore. And yes for me, this is a good problem to have most of my hair to deal with in my 70's. thx"
21613,1,Positive,"I have loved the Exxtra gel for about a decade, and I could sense that a change was coming with this gel quite some time ago. I thought it was being totally discontinued, so I rounded up every bottle I could find in the tan packaging and stock piled them. I was relieved to see Nexxus had released Exxtra gel in a shiny new package, and I promptly bought a few bottles online. My happiness changed forever when I realized that more than just the packaging had changed. Where had my beloved Exxtra gel gone The new formula does nothing for my frizz and curls, and to make matters worse the new scent is so overpowering! Nexxus should have specified on the packaging new formula when this was re-released...It is not the same gel, yet it boasts the same name. I will never buy this product again. I am now saving the rest of my tan Exxtra gel bottles for special occasions, and I'm now on the search for a new gel product all together. Such a shame."
21614,1,Positive,"If you bring back the old formula, I can GUARANTEE/PROMISE you, Nexxus, that I will buy YOUR hair gel, and NOBODY else's. The old formula was the BEST on the market ...period. As long as you sell it, I will buy it. I will not buy this new formula again, once was enough. Please bring the old formula back."
21616,1,Positive,"I have used Nexxus for years, I have fine hair, it was the best gel I had ever used. But no more, it is thin and smells like dish soap. The new tube does not make it any better. I wish I had known they were going to change it. I would have bought a boat load of the old gel."
21620,1,Positive,"I have used Nexxus EXXTRA Gel for years, but it is time to find a new gel if you don't bring back the original formula. I don't like the smell of the new formula and it doesn't hold as well as the old formula. Not to mention, the old formula was the only gel I have been able to find that I was able to get it wet and style my hair again later in the day. I won't buy another Nexxus product if this new formula is all you are going to sell going forward. And I only gave 1 star because you have to select at least one."
21622,1,Positive,I totally agree with the hundreds of others who are extremely dissatisfied with the new formula and smell of what used to be the best hair gel on the market. I have been using this gel for 30+ years so why change it now! Nothing works like this one did. Please go back to the old formula!!! And please get rid of the horrid smell!
21624,1,Positive,"2 out of 5 stars. Donald 2 months ago YOU CHANGED THE FORMULA.....NOT GOOD! Dear Nexxus: I have used your Exxtra Gel, Superior Hold for several years, sold in the tan colored tube. Within the last 6 months or so, the packaging has changed to the copper colored tube, and the gel is different as well. It is less thick and does not hold as well. I was in a store recently and managed to find the older version. It reaffirms my contention that this new formula is not as effective as the old one. Please bring it back!!! Yes, I recommend this product. Review photo 1 Photo This action will open a modal dialog.

Were happy to note that we are tweaking the product and will have the improved/restored formulation back shortly."
21625,1,Positive,"I have used the old formula since 2003 and I was super happy with it. The new one is so bad and doesn't hold my hair. I had to start searching for different brands. If you don't want to loose all your consumers , bring the old gel back !!!!"
21627,1,Positive,"The new Exxtra Gel formula is awful. The old formula was by far the best offered in the market in terms of providing an extra long-lasting hold along with a wet look when desired. The new formula provides zero utility and smells offensive to boot with an undeniably far more powerful fragrance. PLEASE bring the old formula back. I saw Nexus responding in posts last month that an improved/restored formulation will be offered shortly. I really hope this comes to fruition. Although no competitor products I have recently tried come close to measuring up to the original formula, several are indeed superior to your new offering and will unfortunately become my go-to once my current supply of old Exxtra Gel is gone."
21630,1,Positive,The new formula is horrible......please bring back the old one!!!!
21633,1,Positive,"I have been using your sculpting gel for quite a few years now and found it really made a difference for my straight hair to hold a style. This new formulation in the pinkish bronze tube does nothing at all, has no hold to it. I do not recommend it for any hair type. So why did you change your formula, Nexxus"
21634,1,Positive,"Was disappointed when tried to purchase the usual Exxtra gel and saw they were out. I finally found it but noticed the packaging was different. Much to my surprise I found that they had changed the formula. I gave it a try and immediately notice that this was definitely not the same, nor was as good. First was the fragrance, the old had little to no smell to it, but this new one had too strong a smell. I don't want my hair product to have a scent, that is what cologne is for. My wife immediately commented to me that the scent bothered her. The next issue is that the feel, hold and and styling was not as good as before. It make my hair my hair feel soft after, but so did the original. Bottom line is I don't think this is as good a product as the original. Please bring the original formula back and soon. I loved the old product much better!"
21635,1,Positive,"I can no longer find the original Exxtra Gel - Superior Hold gel that I've been using for years, so I did try your new formula. I do not like it. I returned it. I find that the new formula does not hold as well as the original, and the new scent is way too strong! From your responses to the other disappointed reviews, I'm guessing that you will suggest I call your customer service number, which I will, but will Nexxus consider bringing the original formula back"
21639,1,Positive,Customer for 5 years / Found Alternative Product but would be Happy to become a Loyal Customer Again if the product is returned to its Original Formula.
21640,1,Positive,"Please bring back the old formula! I echo the voice of many here. I have used Exxtra Gel for many years. I have straight hair. The old formula helped style my hair and the shine could not be touched by any other brand. I too, would get many compliments. I will use it again. Please, please bring back the old formula. Do you have an ETA"
21642,1,Positive,"I have been using this sculpting gel for over 10 years and have always gotten compliments on how great my thick curly hair was. Strangers would literally stop me to compliment me on my hair and ask what products I use. I would ALWAYS reccomend Nexxus super hold sculpting gel as my must have product. Unfortunately, the formula has been changed and the new one is no where near the original. Since then, I have tried loads of other gels from ridiculously priced high end to drug store specials and have come up disappointed with all of them. Nothing is like the original sculpting gel. Apparently after seeing the overall response to this product, I am clearly not alone on this. I have a tiny bit left of the old formula that I use sparingly for special occasions, this is pathetic lol!! Please bring the old formula back!!!"
21644,1,Positive,"I do not know why you changed your extra gel, but it is not the same as the old kind with the other bottle. I have EXTREMELY curly hair and I used that for over 10 years and you all of a sudden you change it!!!!! Please bring it back. The new kind does NOT hold like the other!!!!!I am lost without it!!!!!!"
21646,1,Positive,Not nearly as good as before. The scent is not good. The gel seems runnier and does not hold as well. Just bring back the old formula!!!! I would switch back if I could get the old gel!!!! For now I have moved on to a better product.
21649,1,Positive,"The old gel is better, please it bring back. I don't like the smell of the new gel and it's too watery. A bottle of the old gel lasted for at least 2 weeks, the new gel 1 week."
21655,1,Positive,"I'm a little late to the party, but like many others have been very disappointed with the new formula for the Exxtra Gel. I had used the older formula for 5-10 years and was very happy with it. The new version has a heavy scent and doesn't hold my hairstyle as well. I'm using it only because it is time consuming and expensive to find a replacement. Would much prefer the old formula be reintroduced."
21658,1,Positive,The new formula does not hold like the old. It is greasy and smells bad. The old formula worked great so why change. Please bring back old formula!
21660,1,Positive,"I have probably been using Nexxus extra hold for a good 25 years. My favorite was when we could purchase the product in the pump which has been gone for some time now. Recently, I went to buy the renamed exxtra superior hold only to find out the product is discontinued What happened to my good old Nexxus Exxtra Hold gel that gave my hair the wet look and incredible hold The new gel is so potent in smell and just does not offer the same quality that I have become accustom to over the past few decades. Unfortunately it is time to look for an alternate product as the new regime of Nexxus gel's are no longer meeting my needs."
21662,1,Positive,I have used this gel for several years and loved it. The new formula's scent is awful and the gel doesn't hold my hair like the old formula. I will not buy another tube of this gel. I don't understand why it was changed in the first place.
21664,1,Positive,"The new product is a huge downgrade. The water and alcohol content cheapens the quality and the product, Please bring back the old product"
21665,1,Positive,I have been using this product for many years until recently the entire formula was changed. I am not happy with the new formula and I would like to know if I can purchase any of the old formula.
21668,1,Positive,Been using the old product for years and hands down best on the market. The new product is terrible and feels like you added slime to your hair. The old product was awesome and worked well. After application it dried and the hold was awesome and no flaking. Please discontinue the new product and go back to the old!!
21670,1,Positive,"I have been a loyal user of Nexxus Exxtra Gel for 20+ years. I loved it!! I would get compliments on my hair all the time and I have recommended it many times over the years. Nexxus, why did you change a good thing!! The new formula is thinner, has dried out my hair, does not control frizz at all and smells horribly like rubbing alcohol. I feel like I am using hand sanitizer on my hair!! Sadly, I am desperately searching for a new product to use on my hair. The only way I would purchase this product again is if you brought back your old formula."
21671,1,Positive,I have used the gel for 20 plus years...the new/revised product does not work nearly as well nor do I like the fragrance.
21672,1,Positive,"The new gel is no where near as good as the old gel. Perhaps its a financial decision to dilute the old gel and get 1.3 -1.5 more bottles out of one of the old thereby generating more revenue, OR perhaps its about a need for a new product yet not offering a market test Either way they DO need to bring the old one back. IN the alternative maybe Nexxus can offer the old gel for sale Online ONLY and see what the consumer preference is"
21673,1,Positive,"Like a lot of other customers posts about this product, I do not like the change. I too have used this gel for years and loved it. I was hooked the 1st time I tried it. My hair is thick and naturally curly. I deal with a fair amount of frizz, a daily ordeal and nothing has helped like.Nexxus Gel. Now, I put your gel in my hair and as my hair dries it starts to feel like glue. Once my hair is dry, along with the feel of glue my hair feels like straw. I can't run my hand through my hair. I used to be able to get up the day after I washed my hair and add more gel to control any frizz. Now with the new gel when I try to put more gel in my hair, my hair feels like a stiff gluey mess. Stiff as straw and impossible to comb, even with a wide tooth comb. There's no shine, totally dull and lifeless. I was mortified some one might try to touch my hair. Really gross. I washed it out of my hair and never used it again. I've got half a tube and a full tube sitting in my closet, not being used! Please bring back your old gel! PLEASE!!!! Thank you"
21675,1,Positive,"I loved the original formula. My hair was moisturized and shiny when I used it, most importantly the hold was firm but not crunchy. I used the new formula thinking that the bottle was redesigned. I noticed a difference in the formula too when my hair started to frizz. The scent was too much to bear and there was flaking!!! I never experienced flaking with this gel before. Now I must find a new gel or make my own flax seed gel."
21678,1,Positive,"I was a faithful costumer for 15+ years! My hair is now dry, curls are unrefined, frizzy, the smell is way toooo strong, please please bring back old formula!!!!"
21679,1,Positive,The original product was great! The new product does not even come close to holding the hair as the original did. The new fragrance is also not pleasant. PLEASE bring back the original Nexus Gel Exxtra!!!!!!!!!!
21680,1,Positive,I have used the old formula for almost 20 years the current product has less hold and it smells like a hospital antiseptic. Please bring the old formula back -- call it Classic Exxtra Hold or something.
21682,1,Positive,I was a faithful user of the original Gel I absolutely loved it but this new stuff is horrible whoever decided to change this should be fired!
21683,1,Positive,"I HAVE BEEN USING THE PREVIOUS GEL PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND WHEN I WENT TO PURCHASE A NEW ONE SINCE MINE RAN OUT , I BOUGHT THIS ONE I USED IT ONCE AND WITHIN 6 HOURS OF USING IT, I HAD TO REWASH MY HAIR BECAUSE I COULDN'T STAND THE SMELL! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
21684,1,Positive,"I have used Exxtra Gel since 1988 and it WAS the best gel on the market until earlier in 2015 when you made the mistake of re-formulating it. It is thinner in consistency and doesn't hold nearly as well as the previous formula. Now about the new scent, it is the most horrible smell you could have ever invented! Consider the fact that just as many men use your gel as women do, besides you don't need to add fragrance to styling gel. Men use cologne and women perfume. I have been using gel from one of your competitors, but if you restore your exxtra gel to the previous formula I will return to Nexxus."
21685,1,Positive,I have used Nexxus EXXTRA Gel for almost 20 years and am very upset that the formula has changed. It does not compare with the old Gel and I don't like the strong smell. Please give us our old formula back. If you don't I have to find something else.
21686,1,Positive,Been using this product for over 15 years. Why would they change a good thing Please bring back the old formula
21687,1,Positive,I've used Exxtra Gel for 20 years - it WAS the best styling product on the market. New formula smells like body odor and it doesn't perform as well. HORRIBLE!!! I used it and had to wash my hair to get the odor out!!! PLEASE bring back the original formula. Why did you change such a great product
21688,1,Positive,"The original version was a wonderful, dependable product I have used for many, many years and was taken off the market and changed for no good reason when it worked so well. It has a repulsive fragrance and is more watery. I actually had to rewash my hair 30 minutes after using it because I could not bear the fragrance. Extremely disappointed and don't know what I will do now after all these years using the Exxtra Gel as it previously was marketed."
21690,1,Positive,"As I'm sure you know by now, and comments by your company indicate, you will be bringing back the old formula because the vast majority of folks thinks your new version is terrible and unless this is changes soon, you will loose decades old customers including myself. My question is when should we see this--You need to get on it and make this happen very quickly."
21691,1,Positive,I have used this product for over 15 years. It WAS the best. The new formula is sticky and it stinks. Please bring back the old formula. I've noticed that everyone agrees. Why did you change it
21692,1,Positive,"I called nexxus when I bought the new gel and let them know the old formula is the only gel that has ever worked in my hair. I Have very long thick curly hair and use 4 bottles a month , I went out and searched every store for all the old bottles left on the shelves at home Ievery store that carried it. I am now looking for something different to start using. Unless you put the old stuff back I will never buy nexxus products again. Really hoping to see it back ."
21693,1,Positive,"Please bring back the old one, as others I have been using it for years and was very satisfied. I am bringing the new one back to the store and going to try to find a new gel that doesn't stink."
21696,1,Positive,So upset that nexxus changed their gel. It was my favorite for years until it changed. I can't use this new gel. Dries my hair out. I have to find a new gel.
21698,1,Positive,"Why did you change this product I am now looking for a new gel. It seems every time I find a product I really like, the company either discontinues it or changes it."
21699,1,Positive,"Different ingredients in new product (oils) not good for fine, thin hair that needs volume. Bring back old product!!!!"
21702,1,Positive,Nexxus Exxtra Gel is no longer a product I will buy. The formulation has changed it does not perform anything akin to the previous product. I've been using this product for many years and will look for a replacement product.
21704,1,Positive,"I am a few months away from turning 50 and started using Nexxus Exxtra gel when I entered the military at age 18!!! Nexus Exxtra gel has been my/the ONLY gel that I have used or would use in more than 30 years...though the packaging has changed over the past 30+ years, the formula has ALWAYS remained true until now. Beleive me, it was perfect and you really should go back!!! The ORIGINAL formula was a great consistency to apply, superior hold, no flaking when combed out and absolutely no heavy build up....even after several days of use....NONE! My hair has always been important to me and my one TRIED and TRUE gel has changed. PLEASE change back.... When something is perfect, you don't change....read the hundreds and soon to be thousands of other reviews on this change.... Everyone hates the new stuff. I'm a 30 year veteran of your original product and hate the new stuff....you know it's not the same as soon as you apply it in your hands!"
21705,1,Positive,The new product is very strong smelling and gave me a headache. I will not be using it in the future.
21710,1,Positive,I have been using this product for many years and it was superior to all others on the market. I just bought a new tube two weeks ago and it different. It no longer holds my hair in place and is much more watery. I will no longer buy this product as it is.
21713,1,Positive,I have been hunting for the grey/tan bottle for months but can only find themes rose colored tube gel. Please go back to the grey tube. The old formula was perfect for my curls. I can't find any products out there now that I like including the new rose bottle. It just doesn't hold anything! Besides I used to get so many compliments with the old formula now I just look like a frizz ball!! So sad!!
21714,1,Positive,New formula smells bad and does not hold like the old formula. I also had a problem where the tube broke open on the side and started leaking. The packaging feels and looks real cheap. After 10 plus years of using this product I'm now looking for a new gel.
21715,1,Positive,"Like most others with curly hair it's near impossible to find the perfect product or combination of products to control the frizz and not kill your curl. The old version was awesome, smelled good and worked great with only small amounts needed. Who in the world changed it Did you use a focus group of actual customers The new product is terrible, doesn't do anything for my hair, is thin and smells terrible (like an old lady coming from the beauty parlor). For the love of all that's right, change it back PLEASE!!! 240 out of 270 reviewers hate it, I can't think of a better reason to go back to the original! Listen to your loyal customers Nexxus, or you'll lose them."
21717,1,Positive,"I loved the old formulation of this product. It was absolutely perfect. The shine, the stylability, the glossy, shiney finish. This newer version is stickier to work with, has a duller finish and the fragrance is more perfumey now instead of the previous cleaner, fresher scent. I am so disappointed that you discontinued making the other earlier - more perfect gel."
21719,1,Positive,"I have been using Nexxus Extra Gel since the 80's....back when it was sold in salons. I have course, thick, curly hair and am also a professional hair stylist. I have tried tons of professional gels over the years and never found one that kept my curls nice and controlled fritz the way the OLD NEXXUS FORMULA did. The new formula is HORRIBLE!!! My hair is lifeless, frizzy and dull. I have also noticed my scalp itches quite a bit which I have never experienced before, but am unsure if the new formula could be causing it or not. PLEASE! Go back to the old formula! You had a great product for thick, curly hair! Most gels out there are so watery and are not compatible with that hair type. So many companies cater to normal or fine hair types, it is ridiculous. After reading so many of the reviews I am hoping you honor your loyal customers requests and go back to the old formula! If you want to change anything on the old formula you could change the scent... it smells more masculine. A more sweet, fresh scent would be nice.... but using the old formula!"
21720,1,Positive,"Completely unusable. I have used this for the last 10 yrs, but needed to switch to another product. The old product had a very mild fragrance and was fine for a guy to use in a professional work environment. I have switched to a Redken, but would switch back in a minute if they brought back the old product."
21722,1,Positive,"As others have stated, I've used this product for many years and was so happy that it was affordable and did what it said it would. I have very fine thin hair and this was just the ticket for getting some texture and hold. Why do companies have to fix what ain't broke I can only assume it has to do with cheaper ingredients. This makes me sad!"
21724,1,Positive,"I was an advis user of Nexxus Extra Gel. I recently purchased a new bottle. I absolutely LOVE the fragrance, however they must have changed the formula because my curls are not the same. I wish they would go back to the original formula. It's just not the same. Sorry Nexxus."
21725,1,Positive,I used to use the Nexxus Exxtra Gel all the time before they changed to product and added fragrance. The gel did not hold up well anymore and my hair smelled like a woman kind of hard to use it when your man. Wish they still had the old non fragranced gel.
21726,1,Positive,A couple years ago I tried the Nexxus Exxtra Gel and it was the best gel I had ever used. I was an instant fan and became a loyal customer of this and some of the other Nexxus products. I would brag about Nexxus anytime a stylist asked me to try something different. Unfortunately I'm no longer a fan after having bought two bottles of the newly formulated Nexxus Exxtra Gel. The new formula is now the worst gel I have ever used and I'm upset that the new prettier packaging didn't bother to advertise they changed the formula. I bought the first bottle and thought someone must have tampered with it because it smelled like baby oil. when I bought the second bottle I realized that the formula really had been changed to one that seemed watered down and cheap. It has turned me away from the Nexxus product line I once bragged about and my stylists are happy that I'm buying different brands from them again.
21729,1,Positive,I have used this product for years for my curls and ABSOLUTELY love it! But it has been changed and it not nearly as good. PLEASE bring back the old formula in the gold tube!
21730,1,Positive,"Ive been using the EEXTRA GEL SUPERIOR HOLD Sculpting Gel for four years and loved it. When I got the new one I thought maybe it is just a new tube color but to my disappointment it was a completely new and definitely NOT improved product. I have thick dry curly hair and the original product made it look so nice and natural. I was always stopped by other curley women who wanted to know my secret. I would apply it on wet hair and twirl my curls. Once dried, the hair wasnt stiff like in other products and it really looked great for at least two days. The new products is hard to apply it doesnt sculpt and stays frizzy. I have to use a lot more to maintain some shape to the curls. Once it dries, my curls feel stiff and they look dead and lackluster. I am so disappointed. Why did Nexus feel the need to change a good product I loved it. I didnt even mention the yucky smell because that is the least of my problems. I wont continue using this product that is for sure."
21732,1,Positive,"I have used Nexxus Exxtra Gel for years and just purchased a new tube. I am very disappointed in the new product. It has made my hair oily and I do not like the scent. I will be looking for a replacement product on my next shopping trip. I can't imagine why you changed something that was so good to begin with. Also, the new tube has a lot more ingredients than my old tube. Please go back to the original recipe."
21733,1,Positive,"The previous product (Exxtra Gel) worked great, but now the new product (the same brand as before) does not work at all, the strength of which is not enough to hold the hair style. Can you tell me the difference"
21735,1,Positive,"Simply put, the new product does not work. Have been a loyal customer for years but will have to switch. This was a big mistake in changing the formula as you will definitely lose long-term customers. I hope you reconsider your decision and bring the old formulation back."
21738,1,Positive,"I had been using the old formula for a great number of years an loved it. The new formula is thinner, has a stronger fragrance which competes with my cologne and has less hold. I can't image why Nexxus would find this to be an improvement. NOT a good move. I want my old product back!!!"
21739,1,Positive,"After using this product for many, many years, it has been changed and it is nothing like the original product. It is not at all effective as a styling gel."
21741,1,Positive,"This gel used to be great. They recently reformulated it and it is a very different product with the same name. At first, I figured they just updated the packaging, but as soon as I squirted some out, the difference was obvious. It looks different, smells different, and behaves very differently in your hair. Honestly, they should have just said that they were discontinuing the product and came up with a new name for it. The ingredients are not the same. I don't know what they were thinking.Personally, I have curly/wavy hair and I don't find that this stuff holds up throughout the day. Especially on humid days, when my hair just looks poofy. I am currently trying to find a new hair gel that I like as much as the old version of this product. I will not be buying this product again, unfortunately."
21742,1,Positive,Nexxus has changed their exxtra gel. The new formula makes hair a frizzy mess. Look St how old the other reviews are. They are for the old formula which was great.
21745,2,Positive,So I have naturally dry coily hair and I honestly have a fear of gels because they often dry white but this one did not! But I didn't get any of the hold effect. I don't know if it's because I didn't use enough(worrying that it would dry white) or if it just doesn't work for my 4C hair. I will try again and apply more product and see if it helps! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
21746,2,Positive,"I'm bummed!!!! I want they old formula back!!! This new stuff is ok, but the old gel was 100 better. You guys blew it big time!"
21748,2,Positive,"The original product was better so, now I will have to look for a replacement."
21750,2,Positive,Like all the other posts what happened I loved the old formula... I used it for many years and it worked great. I don't like the new formula or the packaging. Please bring it back...
21751,2,Positive,"I have been using this for many years and loved it. However, the new formula smells terrible and the hold is not as strong... what happened Bring back the old formula. I have started looking for alternative products."
21755,2,Positive,"I finally found the perfect gel for my thick hair. It kept it in place all day didn't flake. Then Suddenly I couldn't find it in any store. I bought the one in the pink tube, not realizing it replaced the grey tube. I don't like it. It's watery, smelly doesn't hold my hair in place for more than a couple of hours. Bring back the old formula."
21756,2,Positive,"I have been using Exxtra Gel for 20+ years. I have long, naturally curly hair and it was the best gel that I've found to work well AND I (used to) get compliments all the time on how good my hair smells. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in the formula and I HATE the new scent! I've found my hair gets frizzy quicker and doesn't feel as soft after applying gel. PLEASE, PLEASE bring back the old formula... and scent!!"
21757,2,Positive,"I've been using the original product for around 15 years. I saw the new packaging and thought it was just marketing, however the formula has changed too. I apply this product to my hair before it fully dries, now with the new thinner formula all the hold is gone by the time my hair is dry. Its as if it is mainly alcohol and evaporates away. Hopefully Nexxus will quickly change the formula back due to all the bad reviews, or I will be looking for a new gel product."
21758,2,Positive,"I have been using this gel for over 10 years. Up until a couple of years ago it said it had UV protection. Then you changed it. Then a couple of weeks ago I ran out and went to get more and you changed it again. It seems more watery, it doesn't hold as well, and it smells different. Today I went and bought a different brand. I hated to, but the Nexxus isn't what it used to be."
21759,2,Positive,"I have been a loyal user of the Nexxus Exxtra Superior Hold Gel product for 10+ years. I've tried other lower priced competitors, but kept coming back to Nexxus based on its performance. However, with this new version doesn't measure up to the old. It's less thick than the older version and the new scent just isn't pleasant ( the older version had a much milder scent)."
21760,2,Positive,"I have use the old product for 7 years and you recently changed it. It now comes in a copper like tube. I will not buy another one, it offers nothing for my hair type. I love the old Gel. Bring it back. This product is runny, does not offer shine or hold. Not a good choice for thick hair."
21761,2,Positive,"I have used Nexxus Exxtra for more than 10 years (even after it was discontinued). So when I saw it back on the market, I had to get it. this new gel is not as thick as the original which is better for today's softer more pliable looking hair. The problem is that the scent is so strong that it makes me not want to use it."
21762,2,Positive,"I had used the previous Nexxus Extra Gel Superior Hold Sculpting Gel for years and loved it! Then it disappeared from my local drugstores for awhile then reappeared in a new peach-colored tube. I'm really disappointed in the new version. The scent is terrible and much too strong. The body, hold, and control I got from the previous version was far superior. And to make matters worse, the tube split along the side during the third use. Now I'm looking for another brand. Why did you have to mess with such a great product!"
21763,2,Positive,"Dear Nexxus: I have used your Exxtra Gel, Superior Hold for several years, sold in the tan colored tube. Within the last 6 months or so, the packaging has changed to the copper colored tube, and the gel is different as well. It is less thick and does not hold as well. I was in a store recently and managed to find the older version. It reaffirms my contention that this new formula is not as effective as the old one. Please bring it back!!!"

21840,1,Positive,"Cookies. In my class we tried 3 different types of cookies. Sunny original select, Keebler chips deluxe and chips ahoy. I didnt really like them but they were alright. All the cookies had chocolate chips. they were the same shape and bought at foodmaxx The difference between the cookies were the prices the calories and the tastes."
21841,1,Positive,Love Chips Ahoy. But bought these from Walmart they were old dry and crumbly.
21843,1,Positive,They where really dark didn't taste good at all and the date said they where fresh but definitely didn't taste as such.
21844,1,Positive,I purchased these cookies and got them home only to find most of the cookies were broken into pieces.
21846,2,Positive,"In my work this week we examined and tasted three different brands of cookies (store-bought). The cookie brands were Chips Ahoy, Sunny Select, and Keebler Deluxe. We looked at the physical appearance, the sensory description, and the consumer description. Some similarities of all the cookies are listed below: All three cookies were chocolate chip original. All package sizes were 24. All cookies were dry and crumbly. All have chemical bitter aftertaste. Some differences are listed below: The price is different for all three cookies( Chips Ahoy: 4.29, Sunny Select: 2.49, and Keebler Deluxe: 3.49) Taste Given the information I have found I would not buy store- bought due to processing and unknown chemicals."
21915,1,Positive,"I bought this silky version just to try a new scent.. i usually buy the white jasmine detoxifying body wash, after the first use my skin was red and itchy but i thought it may have been a new perfume i had recently bought. i stopped using the perfume and continued using the body wash only to end up with very red, itchy and bumpy skin... i HIGHLY suggest you pass this product by when shopping for a new body wash."
21916,1,Positive,The new versions of Caress bar soap smell way to strong - they stunk up our whole house. I had to wrap them in plastic and give them to a homeless shelter. Please go back to the wonderful original scent.
21918,2,Positive,"Helpful product, every one's should use it.really good one."
21984,1,Positive,"I bought a 6-pack of these Feit 60W Equivalent Warm White (3000K) A19 LED bulbs, but I also bought a few Phillips 60W Equivalent Warm White LED bulbs too. They looked exactly the same, so I wanted to see how they compared, and I'm glad I did. Upon installing these bulbs in various fixtures around the house, I have noticed that every one of the Feit bulbs flicker - reacting to the slightest frequencies. Initially, I attempted to just put up with it, because they were cheap, but now it has become increasingly irritating. In comparison, the Phillips LED bulbs I purchased have a warmer white light, and they also do not flicker. So yes, the extra few cents I saved by going for these cheap Fiet bulbs - definitely NOT worth it. Go for quality, not quantity."
21986,2,Positive,"A little cooler in color than most 2700K, but the real problem is that they flicker. I'm using a Lutron C.L dimmer with 2 lamps in the circuit. They flicker randomly and a lot. They work fine in non-dimmed fixtures, but not usable in a dimmer circuit."
21987,2,Positive,"Bought this to replace CFL 2700K bulbs in a fixture where soft white looks nice....these bulbs are not omni directional (only top half shines) and the color is not as soft as indicated by the packaging. Will have to return for CFLs, apparently LEDs with GU24 base are not yet available in 2700K. If you can avoid fixtures with this socket I would not buy GU24 again. Too hard to find appropriate, efficient bulbs!"
22023,1,Positive,"I have the grapefruit facial scrub which I love and smells great, but this body wash is really disappointing. It has virtually no smell at all... to the point where I wonder if I got a bad batch or something Just a very faint plasticky soap smell. There's nothing impressive or rejuvenating about the way it works either. Doesn't exactly dry out my skin, doesn't really moisturize it either. Seems like a product from the 99 store. Also, the pop top on the bottle doesn't work so I have to unscrew the whole top to use it."
22025,2,Positive,"I can tell by looking at the container that this will not work. I will have to find another container with a suitable top and put the body wash in it before I use it. Otherwise I would have to set it in the shower without the top, because this top is not going to work."
22059,2,Positive,"The vegetables are tasty. The broth is too light for my taste, like eating vegetables in water."
22065,2,Positive,This stuff is very shiny like unicorn glitter. So I guess if you are going for full on glitter face this is your product. But if you are just looking for a light bronzer or highlight this is not what you want.
22108,1,Positive,"For the price I expected this to be one of the better hand creams. The moisturiser is non-greasy but soaks in and dries so fast that it feels like it has just evaporated. With every use my hands were left just as dry as before. I gave the cream weeks of use to see if it would improve, but it never did. I applied more and more with each use and more often throughout the day but it never made a difference. My hands were getting so bad they were cracking and bleeding. I've resorted to another brand entirely and use it only once a day and the change and improvement in my skin was instant and fixed my damaged broken skin in under a week. Don't waste your money on this cream."
22211,1,Positive,"Idris Elba was originally cast in the lead role. Apparently before the budget was cut dramatically. Had they stuck with that decision, this film could have been a great deal better. As it is, Tyler Perry is awful as the lead. Every scene with him speaking made me cringe. I knew this movie was a throw away when I read a producer's quote (after switching from Idris to Tyler) that said, ""if you can get Will Smith or Tyler Perry, you do it""... Like Perry is in the same league as Will Smith when it comes to mass market, big budget films. Yes, he's had a fair amount of success, but in a very narrow range of film types."
22212,2,Positive,I was way more excited or this movie than I should have been. Bummer
22213,2,Positive,"I'm a huge fan of James Patterson and although few movies are as good as the book, this one was a disappointment to me. I'm not feeling the casting of Tyler Perry as Alex Cross. Ok movie to watch on a rainy day."
22351,1,Positive,Bring back the old formula! This new formula is horrible. The following day my hair is super oily. Also they added biotin in their new formulas... Biotin makes my hair fallout. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!!!!!!!!!
22352,1,Positive,The total care original formula was the best! It was the only shampoo that I would use. It had the best scent and my hair reacted really well with it. I am extremely disappointed with the new formula. It weighed down my hair and I did not like the smell at all. I won't be purchasing this shampoo anymore unless the original total care comes back.!
22353,1,Positive,"I'm very disappointed with the new formula. I used to love this shampoo and recommended it to everyone! The old formula worked great with my fine, oily hair. I gave the new formula a try and it weighs down my hair and starts to get oily by late afternoon. Unfortunately, I will no longer be buying this product as my hair can't take it."
22354,1,Positive,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one completely disappointed with the new formula!!!! I, too, have been using the old Total Care for years. It cleared up my scalp, left my hair shiny, and smelled fantastic. I was impressed because it cleared up my scalp without using the main ingredients in other dandruff shampoos. Now I guess I have to go on a hunt for the old formula and stock up or you just lost yet ANOTHER customer!!!! My only guess is the new formula is cheaper and you get to sell it for the same price. What ever happened to quality products.."
22355,1,Positive,"I loved this shampoo!!! It used to make my hair feel and smell soooo good!!! And the smell was so awesome and lasted til my next shampoo. I would always have people tell me how good I smelled and ask me what it was and I would say... Thanks, it's my hair! Several of my friends and coworkers switched shampoo because of how soft and shiny mine was and how good it smelled. But now sad to say, this is the last I will buy unless the new formula returns! My hair is so oily now and while in the shower the new smell is sooo strong and obnoxious it literally gives me a headache, but as soon as my hair dries no more smell. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, Bring back the original!!!"
22356,1,Positive,"Used the old formula for several years, people would compliment the way my hair smelled and looked all the time! The new formula leaves my hair weighed down and is just not the same. I'm sad that I now have to try to find a new shampoo that I will be happy with again."
22357,1,Positive,The new formula is not working. I bought one bottle and will not buy another. The new and improved has done nothing for my hair. It has caused dry scalp and skin irritation. Please bring back the original formula.
22358,1,Positive,I really miss your old scent been buying it for ever because of it I always got compliments. Got people to change to this shampoo and conditioner. Always had that scent all day long really miss the scent
22359,1,Positive,"I have used CLEAR Total care shampoo and conditioner every since it hit the shelves and was very pleased with the product. It left my hair frizz free, light and not weighed down smelly great. Since the new formula has been released, my hair is weighed down and the new fragrance is horrible."
22360,1,Positive,"I'm very disappointed with the new formula. I used to love this shampoo and recommended it to everyone! The old formula worked great with my fine, oily hair. I gave the new formula a try and it weighs down my hair and starts to get oily by late afternoon. Unfortunately, I will no longer be buying this product as my hair can't take it."
22362,1,Positive,This shampoo brought my dandruff back :(. I loved how the old total care shampoo smelled. Will try another brand now.
22363,1,Positive,I do not like the new formula...I loved the old Clear Total care formula and scent. Please go back to this or at least have it as an option for purchase!
22364,1,Positive,"Use to love this product and would get compliments on how good my hair would smell.. The new formula weights down my hair, makes it oily and makes you smell like you bathed in tanning lotion.. please bring back the old formula!"
22366,1,Positive,Am very displeased with the new formula. The scent doesn't last in my hair like before. I wished you all would switch back to the old formula or make both so we can choose which one we want to buy
22367,1,Positive,The new coconut scent is nowhere near as fabulous as the original scent. It is highly disappointing. Please bring back the old formula.
22371,1,Positive,"As a long time user of this shampoo I was extremely disappointed to find the new formula is unusable for me. The old formula had a fantastic scent that was light and clean. Certain flowery scents give me migraines, so scent is a big factor for me in hair products. The new version is heavily scented and intolerable for me. The old formula left my hair clean, shiny, and manageable. Two days of the new formula left my hair heavy and greasy. Please bring back the old formula, otherwise you've lost a customer. :-("
22374,1,Positive,What happened I used to love Clear Shampoo because of how amazing it smelled and how light it made my hair. Now it smells so bad. Coconut doesn't even do anything. The formula is way too thick and made my hair feel really gross. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!
22375,1,Positive,"This shampoo and conditioner combo was my holy grail! Since they've changed the formula I have not been able to find anything that comes close. So sad...I have no idea why it changed, but please, please bring it back. Thank you!"
22376,1,Positive,"I used to absolutely love this shampoo conditioner! My favorite part was the smell! It was phenomenal! I would get compliments on my hair everyday saying my hair smelt delicious! When I purchased this new formula I was so Dissappointed. The scent was completely different, and as a woman with oily hair, this product weighed my hair down. I will not be repurchasing this product again. Now on the search for a new, great-smelling shampoo."
22377,1,Positive,"Not a fan of the new formula, and particularly despise the new scent. This was the only shampoo conditioner I purchased for the past 4 years, and would have continued to do so if they hadn't changed it. I never write reviews but felt compelled to in hopes they would bring back the original. Until that happens, I'm forced to shop for a different brand because formula aside, I honestly can't stand the scent of the new shampoo conditioner."
22378,1,Positive,"I started using Clear Total Care since it first came out. I loved it! I have a sensitive scalp and other products made it either too oily or too dry but not Clear, that is until their new formula! My scalp is both itchy and oily and the wonderful fragrance that lingered all day is also gone in the new formula:( I will not be using this product. Several of my family members and friends that used the old formula have also discontinued using the new Clear. So bummed!"
22379,1,Positive,Please bring back the old formula. I really dislike the new formula. Plus it makes my hair greasy!! i am not a fan of the new scent ! A lot of my friends have stopped using this brand because of the formula change!!
22380,1,Positive,"I've been a clear lover for a while now, it was the only shampoo I bought because it didn't give me dandruff and the biggest reason I bought was because it smelt AMAZING! Everything was perfect (p.s I used only strong lengths shampoo and conditioner) until no store sells them anymore and they only sell the newer 24/7 bottles and I just can't stand the new smell..They've lost me as a customer because of this. :/"
22381,1,Positive,The total care original formula was the best! It was the only shampoo that I would use. It had the best scent and my hair reacted really well with it. I am extremely disappointed with the new formula. It weighed down my hair and I did not like the smell at all. I won't be purchasing this shampoo anymore unless the original total care comes back.!
22383,1,Positive,One of the main reasons I have loved Clear shampoo is the wonderful scent it had. The new scent is terrible and I don't feel like I get the same results as I used to. Please bring back the old formula!
22384,1,Positive,I really don't like the new coconut smell. Please bring back the wonderful scent back for us. Obviously I am not the only one like that smell. I just bought 3 bottles of shampoo and 2 conditioner and discovered the smell has been changed to a coconut one. It really disappointed me with the smell and I am gonna return it. Sad to say that I am not going to repurchase it unless the wonderful scent being brought back :(

22387,1,Positive,Do not care for new formula of shampoo and conditioner for 24/7 Total Care. Would really like the old formula back!
22389,1,Positive,The previous formula made my hair feel so healthy and luscious. It also smelled SUPER good. I've used it for 4 years and I used to get tons of compliments on the scent even after exercising. I'm very unhappy with how it's being made now.
22394,1,Positive,I loved this shampoo/conditioner when it first came out. It made my hair soft and silky and I could go 2 days without washing (I have super oily hair). Now my hair is greasy and tends to flake. BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA! This one even smells different!
22395,1,Positive,"I loved this shampoo!!! It used to make my hair feel and smell soooo good!!! And the smell was so awesome and lasted til my next shampoo.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, Bring back the original!!!"
22396,1,Positive,"Used to religiously buy and used this product with the old forma. The way it made my hair feel and look was amazing. The scents were sooo pleasant. The new formula makes my hair gross, greasy and not fresh looking. And the new scents are absolutely awful. Please bring back the old formula and scents. Until then I have completely switched brands."
22397,1,Positive,"I used to love clear. I have very oily hair and it used to help controlling it. When I went to my local big box and saw that they changed bottle and read that it was a new scent I thought I should buy a smaller bottle to see if I like the scent first. GOOD THING I DID! The smell is totally different, it doesn't control my oil anymore and it doesn't give me the body like it used to. I told everyone about clear when I first used it and liked it. Now, I am not so confident about recommending it. Please bring back the old formula and scent! I really don't like this new one."
22398,1,Positive,I don't like any of the new formulas they are not as good as they used to be. I miss everything about the old formulas. Specially strong lengths. So sad everything was change. I hope they bring them back soon!!
22399,1,Positive,"This use to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner, It made my hair look and feel like I just walked out of the salon. I would get compliments on how great my hair smelled several times a day. People would often ask me what I was wearing that smelled so good and I would always reply with a smile It's my hair. Then I purchased this new formula and scent and instantly noticed the difference. My hair was weighted down and looked greasy and there was no beautiful scent. I've switched shampoos since and can't seem to find one that makes my hair look as good or smell as good as this shampoo once did. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD SCENT AND FORMULA. PLEASE!!!!"
22400,1,Positive,"I'm not one to write online reviews, but I am so sadly disappointed in the new formula that I had give the Clear company feedback. I've used the Clear shampoo for normal hair ever since it first hit shelves. I absolutely loved it. For years I was complimented on my extra long hair and asked what shampoo I used. I stopped using any other styling products because my hair didn't need them anymore. I didn't get a haircut for over 2 years, and when I finally went to cut off 14 inches, my hairdresser said, I can't believe how incredibly healthy your hair is after two years without a cut! And then the new formula came out and everything changed. I'm incredibly disappointed in the new formula. My scalp has never felt more oily. Now I blowout my hair at 8am and by 10am it's greasy looking and feels weighed down at the scalp. I actually went out and got a dry shampoo to use in the afternoons because I cant stand the oily feeling on my scalp any longer. I have searched the internet and I've yet to find one positive review of the new formula from other loyal users. I also can't find any explanation of the new formula, what it is, how it is different, why you changed it, other than a blog post New year, New clear. Unfortunately I'll no longer be using what was once a fantastic product, and I'm now in the miserable process of looking for a new shampoo."
22401,1,Positive,"I loved the old formula and scent, I would stock up on it for months! Now the new formula has a scent I don't like and it doesn't make my hair as silky soft and smooth as it used to! Please switch back to the older formula and scent!!!"
22403,1,Positive,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one completely disappointed with the new formula!!!! I, too, have been using the old Total Care for years. It cleared up my scalp, left my hair shiny, and smelled fantastic. I was impressed because it cleared up my scalp without using the main ingredients in other dandruff shampoos. Now I guess I have to go on a hunt for the old formula and stock up or you just lost yet ANOTHER customer!!!! My only guess is the new formula is cheaper and you get to sell it for the same price. What ever happened to quality products.."
22405,1,Positive,"I absolutely loved your original formula Stronger Lengths shampoo and conditioner. My whole family used it, and we all loved the smell and feel of our hair. My hair smelled great ALL DAY! Since you stopped selling it, I tried to switch to 24/7 Total Care, and I'm so disappointed. The smell is not as good or as long-lasting, and it doesn't seem to work as well. Please bring back your original formulas - I miss my Stronger Lengths!!!!"
22406,1,Positive,"OLD FORMULA SHAMPOO WAS MY FAVORITE. THIS ONE DOES NOT DO THE OLD ONE JUSTICE. NOT ONLY DID THE OLD ONE SMELL GREAT, BUT IT WAS JUST AMAZING LEFT MY HAIR LOOKING FLAWLESS. THIS NEW FORMULA DOESN'T DO THE JOB QUITE AS WELL."
22407,1,Positive,"You lost me until you bring back the old scent. The new one I absolutely can't stomach. Is there any left over old scent, if yes then I will buy it all, all of it. Please email me."
22408,1,Positive,I swore by this shampoo and conditioner - it made my hair smooth - I could run a comb through it after washing without any struggle it was silky and wonderful - I would get compliments daily on how great my hair smelled. New formula is AWFUL! I have been on the hunt for something new because I can't continue to use this new formula - makes my hair greasy and heavy. Please let me know if you bring back the old stuff and i'll return!
22411,1,Positive,Please bring back the old formula! It was perfect for my hair. The new formula leaves my hair weighted down and greasy. I have given it a try for months now - and I really wish you'd bring the old formula back.
22412,1,Positive,I used to be obsessed the the original formula. I had never found a shampoo before that made my hair look and smell so great. When I tried the original formula shampoo I was immediately hooked. I got compliments on my hair almost daily. I recommended this product to everone. The scent was absolutely amazing. So with such a wonderful product why change it The new formula leaves my hair greasy and the scent is NOTHING like the original. Im sad to say I'm on the hunt for another shampoo because I wont be buying clear anymore. PLEASE BRING THE OLD FORMULA BACK!
22413,1,Positive,I have been using the old formula and it worked great and smelled even better. Now this new stuff doesn't leave my hair looking or feeling as great and it doesn't smell like anything. I would love to have the old formula back. I have gone to other sites looking for the old stuff and I have managed to get the old conditioner but I get the new shampoo and I am very disappointed.
22414,1,Positive,Please bring back the old formula! This one weighs my hair down and the scent is no where near as good as the original. Unfortunately I will not be purchasing again.
22416,1,Positive,"I wanted to try the new formula before I took the word of the other reviews. The other reviews are CORRECT! The new formula is nothing like the old---my hair felt dry after I rinsed out the shampoo--I have a little of the original formula left so I washed my hair right away to see if there was a difference--AND THERE IS! Before I started using the original formula my hair was thin, stringy, dry and falling out. I have been using the original formula for a few years now and my hair is thicker, shiny, healthy and full! Please bring back the original formula!!!!!!!!!!! I don't want my hair to get thin, dry and stringy again!"
22417,1,Positive,"I have been using Clear products for over 3 years. All my friends and family know that I swear by this shampoo/conditioner, and they have all gotten several recommendations from me to use these products. But after using the new formula and the new scent , I am going to sadly discontinue purchasing your products. I absolutely hate the new scent. It does not smell clean or fresh and the scent doesn't last. For the first time in over 3 years, my hair smells like hair! It also doesn't do anything for my hair, as far as helping with frizz or shine. I am so disappointed. Why would you change a good thing I mean, you guys were given a Allure Best of Beauty Award Winner, for pete's sake!"
22418,1,Positive,I had been using the Clear Strong Lengths formula for about 4 years and it was the only shampoo and conditioner I have ever stuck to...It somehow worked a miracle for my hair! Then all of a sudden I couldn't find it anywhere and I would go to different stores and finally I found it with a new label and thought oh they just changed the packaging.. After the first use I was very disappointed. The old formula smelled and worked so much better! I really hope you consider making the old formula available again.
22419,1,Positive,"The old formula/scent was my holy grail. The new formula has a very plastic toy-like scent, which really deters me from repurchasing this product after being loyal to this brand for my shampoo and conditioner for a long time. Unfortunately, I'll have to start looking elsewhere now."
22420,1,Positive,This formula made my hair flat the next day it felt like it needed a good washing. I love the old formula scent. The coconut oil in the new is overpowering. Please bring back the old formula.
22422,1,Positive,"I hate this new 24/7 total care it made my hair so greasy for days! Please bring back the old formula because it was excellent! It's not only good for my hair and scalp, it also CLEARED my face of ACNE! I have tried many shampoos, different brands and different Clear varieties but ONLY the Original Clear Total Care that didn't give me breakouts and big acne on my face. So please bring back original Total Care!"
22423,1,Positive,"After reading the other reviews, I can now see that Clear has changed its formula, and I now know this is the reason for my scalp trouble. The original formula and scent were AMAZING! I have very dry and damaged hair from repeated coloring and bleaching sessions. But you could never tell because of how beautifully the old formula worked! For years, I had soft, smooth hair, the scent was pleasant, and this shampoo blew away all the others, even the expensive salon brands I've used in the past. The shampoo alone worked well enough to keep my hair at its best, even without conditioner! After using the new formula, I've got excessively oily hair, and painful sebum plugs deep in my scalp. This is horrible. I'm still trying out many different shampoos to see if I can soothe my scalp and control the oiliness. Clear, you had a great thing going... Why mess with a perfect product"
22425,1,Positive,I have used this brand for over 5 years and am disappointed with the recent change in scent. It used to smell so good! What happened Bring back the old 24/7 scent.
22426,1,Positive,New formula does not control oil balance of scalp and hair. Old formula was only shampoo I found to manage the moisture balance of my hair.
22427,1,Positive,This used to be the best why would you change it. The smell isnt as good and My hair not as lively. Bring back the original smell
22428,1,Positive,"I hate leaving bad reviews but this product is aweful. I was so excited when I discovered this shampoo/conditioner several years ago. It left my scalp feeling good, my hair soft and shiny. I didn't even have to straighten my hair any more. People would stop me to tell me how beautiful my hair was. I found it harder and harder to find and my local stores and when I did find it I noticed right off it wasn't the same. I have flakes all in my hair and red bumps all in my scalp. I don't understand why a company would change a formula that worked so well. Guess I will spend more time trying to find the perfect shampoo, unless this company decides to bring back the OLD formula!!! Please!!!"
22429,1,Positive,"If any of you are experiencing the same disappointment as me, PLEASE take just one minute of you time to call clear care consumer services at 1800-372-6389 and let them know how they messed up . I have been using clear total care shampoo and conditioner for years and loved it, and now since they changed the ingredients it has totally changed the condition of my hair. It's now dry at the ends, doesn't nourish my scalp and leaves my hair weighed down looking oily!! Please. Ring back the original formula!! I have tried all the new clear lines and none even come close to how your guys product use to work. If anyone else is experiencing the same issue please call in to report it. Hopefully we can have the Original line brought back.. ughhhh now I need to find a new shampoo and conditioner until then ."
22430,1,Positive,"For years I used Clear, it was amazing. I have curly hair and issues with dry scalp, dandruff, and dry frizzy ends. With Clear Total Care (the original) I went an entire year without trims before I saw a split end. My hair was beautiful and manageable. I loved the way it smelled, too! It was amazing. Now, I'm sad to say, your new products are garbage. It left my hair weighed down, my dandruff is back and I my ends are starting to look frizzy. I loath the smell of coconut. It's everywhere now, every one of your new formulas smells like it. I've tried every one, one time and I will no more. You've lost a very loyal customer."
22431,1,Positive,"This used to be my go-to shampoo, and it helped tremendously with psoriasis. But I just used the new formula and want to know.. why in the world are my hands shimmery Are you telling me there is actually a glitter like substance in a shampoo marketed towards ADULTS NOT HAPPY."
22432,1,Positive,"I've been a loyal Clear Total care user (both shampoo and conditioner) for more than 5 years. I loved it! It never disappointed me. The scent was amazing and left my hair squeaky clean without stripping the moisture. I have dry scalp, dandruff was an issue for me and this duo helped sooooo much! As a result my hair was always silky smooth. BUT now with the new formula. I am so disappointed with the performance. It's just isn't good. Leaves hair smelling greasy, and hair is not as clean. I would have to basically wash my hair everyday with this new formula."
22433,1,Positive,"I was so happy with the old formula, and so very disappointed with the new one. Is there a plan to bring back the old one Otherwise no reason to buy it."
22434,1,Positive,"I bought this shampoo to try out. I had heard that it was supposed to do wonders for your hair. The first time I used it, it worked okay. The second time I used this shampoo, my hair felt waxy, dry, and porous when I rinsed it out of my hair. I then read the full list of ingredients and saw that it had tallow acid in it, which is made from animal fat. No wonder my hair felt waxy. If you like rubbing animal fat through your hair, this product is for you. Needless to say I'll never be using it again."
22435,1,Positive,"My daughter and I have been using the Clear Shampoo and the Clear Conditioners for about 2 years now. Smells great and makes our hair feel soft. However, every few weeks we have had to switch to an alternate shampoo and conditioner for a few days as the Clear would make our scalps itchy. We both were seeing a lot of hair in the drain catcher with every shampooing with the Clear products but just chalked it up to the fact that we both have longer, wavy hair. About a week and a half ago we decided to try something different that a sales clerk suggested. We have been using Paul Mitchell Lavender and Mint shampoo and conditioner and have found we are only losing very few strands of hair with each washing. This leads me to the conclusion that the large amounts of hair in the drain while using the Clear was NOT a normal amount of hair loss! It was caused by the Clear. I will NOT be buying their products again nor do I recommend their products to others."
22436,1,Positive,"I used the original total care shampoo for a few years and I loved it. I got compliments on the look, feel, and scent of my hair daily, by far the best shampoo I and my family have ever used. Sadly that formula is replaced by a new and terrible formula. My hair now is greasy, not shiny, not soft, full of dandruff, heavy, and my hair now does not have that incredible smell that it used to have. I love my hair, but now I do not know what to do to help it because the old shampoo was perfect and now my hair is left to die with this new one. I have not seen anyone who likes this new shampoo. So please bring back the old formula, the non-24/7 total care. I used to recommend your shampoo all the time and I do not understand why you got rid of a beautiful gift to the world. I want to stay loyal to Clear, but you are making it very hard to do so by taking away all of your good products. And I do not know how much longer my hair and scalp can take this new formula because my hair now feels like it's dying."
22437,1,Positive,I do not like the new formula. It doesn't smell as good as before.
22438,1,Positive,"When Clear shampoo hit the market I tried it not really expecting it to solve my problems. I had tried a lot of shampoo brands, and my scalp had terrible reactions to lots of them. To my sheer joy, Clear worked!! My scalp healed, my hair looked great, and I never tried another shampoo or conditioner. Since the new formula my scalp has started having a reaction. I didn't think it was an even a new formula, only a redesigned label, when I bought the new formula. My scalp had a very mild reaction, which I could deal with if my hair didn't look greasy and weighed down after 12 hours of using the shampoo. I noticed a change immediately when I dried my hair after my first wash. It's like this formula is for dry hair. I've stuck with it to see if my hair would adjust and maybe it was all in my head, but the breakouts and greasy hair persist after at least 2 weeks of use. I am so disappointed. I have a travel size of the old formula that I am debating when to use, but don't want to use up at the same time (totally irrational I know)"
22439,1,Positive,"If any of you are experiencing the same disappointment as me, PLEASE take one minute of your time to call clear care consumer services at 1800-372-6389 and let them know how they messed up .

22440,1,Positive,"Clear was my go to shampoo. I have used it ever since it came out. The original formula smelled so incredible. It made my hair soft, smooth, and shiny. I recommended it to everyone. I also used to get several comments on how nice my hair smelled. Then the formula changed. I was in the shower and opened my new bottle of clear and it was no longer the sweet aroma I had loved. It was new it was different, and I did not like it. As soon as I got out of the shower my husband and I went to several stores and bought all the old formula version of clear we could find. But sadly that quickly ran out. The new formula irritated my scalp and made it very sensitive. I now switch between Pantene and Dove shampoo. I would not recommend the new formula of clear shampoo to my worst enemy with how bad it irritated my scalp. I wish they would switch back to the original formula"
22441,1,Positive,"I had been using Clear Total Care for years and loved it. The old scent was amazing, my scalp was no longer itchy or flaky, and it was doing more for my hair and scalp than higher end shampoos. The old formula was perfect for myself and as I can tell, many other as well. I tried to give the new, updated shampoo with coconut milk in it, but it made my hair greasy and my scalp so irritated that I needed to stop using the shampoo after just 2 uses. I, and many others are very disappointed. I will not use this, or any other shampoos from Clear until the old formula of Clear Total Care is back."
22442,1,Positive,"My first problem is I can not find your product anywhere, my second problem is the stuff I can find is this new 24/7 garbage, and I'm sorry for my language but I do mean it. The fragrance is atrocious and nauseating I have very sensitive allergies and can not tolerate the new formula. Your original formula was the only thing that helped my hair. You see I also have Hashimotos, a thyroid condition where hair loss is one of the many side affects of the disease. Since I have stopped using your ORIGINAL formula I have noticed a significant difference in the amount of hair that falls out and it's starting to worry me. I know many woman that have bald spots from this disease, and don't want to end up wearing wigs. I am sitting here crying, I beg you PLEASE bring back the original Clear Scalp and Hair Conditioner, Strong Lengths Shampoo, Strong lengths formula, please, please, please..."
22443,1,Positive,"I LOVED the old Clear Shampoo, the scent was amazing and the quality of the shampooconditioner was far better than it is now. Please bring back the old formula!!!!"
22446,1,Positive,The previous formula made my hair feel so healthy and luscious. It also smelled SUPER good. I've used it for 4 years and I used to get tons of compliments on the scent even after exercising. I'm very unhappy with how it's being made now.
22447,1,Positive,"I used the Clear Scalp shampoo and conditioner for a couple months. I noticed that I was developing sores on my scalp a couple months ago but it went away. Then recently it came back. I stopped using it and my scalp started clearing up. The shampoo made my hair feel great, but left my scalp in bad condition."

Now this new stuff doesn't leave my hair looking or feeling as great and it doesn't smell like anything. I would love to have the old formula back. I have gone to other sites looking for the old stuff and I have managed to get the old conditioner but I get the new shampoo and I am very disappointed.
22457,1,Positive,"The old formula/scent was my holy grail.

22458,1,Positive,This formula made my hair flat the next day it felt like it needed a good washing. I love the old formula scent. The coconut oil in the new is overpowering. Please bring back the old formula.
22459,1,Positive,I used to be obsessed the the original formula. I had never found a shampoo before that made my hair look and smell so great. When I tried the original formula shampoo I was immediately hooked. I got compliments on my hair almost daily. I recommended this product to everone. The scent was absolutely amazing. So with such a wonderful product why change it The new formula leaves my hair greasy and the scent is NOTHING like the original. Im sad to say I'm on the hunt for another shampoo because I wont be buying clear anymore. PLEASE BRING THE OLD FORMULA BACK!

22462,1,Positive,I loved this shampoo/conditioner when it first came out. It made my hair soft and silky and I could go 2 days without washing (I have super oily hair). Now my hair is greasy and tends to flake. BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA! This one even smells different!
22463,1,Positive,I don't like any of the new formulas they are not as good as they used to be. I miss everything about the old formulas. Specially strong lengths. So sad everything was change. I hope they bring them back soon!!
22464,1,Positive,I had been using the Clear Strong Lengths formula for about 4 years and it was the only shampoo and conditioner I have ever stuck to...It somehow worked a miracle for my hair! Then all of a sudden I couldn't find it anywhere and I would go to different stores and finally I found it with a new label and thought oh they just changed the packaging.. After the first use I was very disappointed. The old formula smelled and worked so much better! I really hope you consider making the old formula available again.

22468,1,Positive,"Used to religiously buy and used this product with the old forma. The way it made my hair feel and look was amazing. The scents were sooo pleasant. The new formula makes my hair gross, greasy and not fresh looking. And the new scents are absolutely awful. Please bring back the old formula and scents. Until then I have completely switched brands."
22469,1,Positive,"You lost me until you bring back the old scent. The new one I absolutely can't stomach. Is there any left over old scent, if yes then I will buy it all, all of it. Please email me."
22470,1,Positive,"I loved the old formula and scent, I would stock up on it for months! Now the new formula has a scent I don't like and it doesn't make my hair as silky soft and smooth as it used to! Please switch back to the older formula and scent!!!"
22471,1,Positive,"I wanted to try the new formula before I took the word of the other reviews. The other reviews are CORRECT! The new formula is nothing like the old---my hair felt dry after I rinsed out the shampoo--I have a little of the original formula left so I washed my hair right away to see if there was a difference--AND THERE IS! Before I started using the original formula my hair was thin, stringy, dry and falling out. I have been using the original formula for a few years now and my hair is thicker, shiny, healthy and full! Please bring back the original formula!!!!!!!!!!! I don't want my hair to get thin, dry and stringy again!"
22472,1,Positive,"OLD FORMULA SHAMPOO WAS MY FAVORITE. THIS ONE DOES NOT DO THE OLD ONE JUSTICE. NOT ONLY DID THE OLD ONE SMELL GREAT, BUT IT WAS JUST AMAZING LEFT MY HAIR LOOKING FLAWLESS. THIS NEW FORMULA DOESN'T DO THE JOB QUITE AS WELL."
22474,1,Positive,"This shampoo and conditioner combo was my holy grail! Since they've changed the formula I have not been able to find anything that comes close. So sad...I have no idea why it changed, but please, please bring it back. Thank you!"
22475,1,Positive,What happened I used to love Clear Shampoo because of how amazing it smelled and how light it made my hair. Now it smells so bad. Coconut doesn't even do anything. The formula is way too thick and made my hair feel really gross. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!
22476,1,Positive,"I absolutely loved your original formula Stronger Lengths shampoo and conditioner. My whole family used it, and we all loved the smell and feel of our hair. My hair smelled great ALL DAY! Since you stopped selling it, I tried to switch to 24/7 Total Care, and I'm so disappointed. The smell is not as good or as long-lasting, and it doesn't seem to work as well. Please bring back your original formulas - I miss my Stronger Lengths!!!!"
22477,1,Positive,I swore by this shampoo and conditioner - it made my hair smooth - I could run a comb through it after washing without any struggle it was silky and wonderful - I would get compliments daily on how great my hair smelled. New formula is AWFUL! I have been on the hunt for something new because I can't continue to use this new formula - makes my hair greasy and heavy. Please let me know if you bring back the old stuff and i'll return!
22478,1,Positive,Please bring back the old formula. I really dislike the new formula. Plus it makes my hair greasy!! i am not a fan of the new scent ! A lot of my friends have stopped using this brand because of the formula change!!
22479,1,Positive,"I used to love clear. I have very oily hair and it used to help controlling it. When I went to my local big box and saw that they changed bottle and read that it was a new scent I thought I should buy a smaller bottle to see if I like the scent first. GOOD THING I DID! The smell is totally different, it doesn't control my oil anymore and it doesn't give me the body like it used to. I told everyone about clear when I first used it and liked it. Now, I am not so confident about recommending it. Please bring back the old formula and scent! I really don't like this new one."
22482,1,Positive,"I have been using Clear products for over 3 years. All my friends and family know that I swear by this shampoo/conditioner, and they have all gotten several recommendations from me to use these products. But after using the new formula and the new scent , I am going to sadly discontinue purchasing your products. I absolutely hate the new scent. It does not smell clean or fresh and the scent doesn't last. For the first time in over 3 years, my hair smells like hair! It also doesn't do anything for my hair, as far as helping with frizz or shine. I am so disappointed. Why would you change a good thing I mean, you guys were given a Allure Best of Beauty Award Winner, for pete's sake!"
22483,1,Positive,One of the main reasons I have loved Clear shampoo is the wonderful scent it had. The new scent is terrible and I don't feel like I get the same results as I used to. Please bring back the old formula!
22484,1,Positive,Do not care for new formula of shampoo and conditioner for 24/7 Total Care. Would really like the old formula back!
22485,1,Positive,"My holy grail shampoo and conditioner was Clear with the original scent and formula. It smelled AMAZING and lasted very long on my hair. I always received compliments about how my hair smelled so great. It left my hair very soft and shiny as well. So it used to be my dream shampoo and haven't used anything else. However, when I saw in stores that they changed the formula and scent, I was upset but still wanted to give it a try. I'm very disappointed and saddened that my favorite shampoo is gone and that this new formula is a complete disappointment. Why was there a need to changed the formula when it was perfect Now my hair doesnt smell as good (has a coconut like scent, which I am not a fan of) and it leaves my hair looking dull. Please bring back the old formula!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I'm on the search for a new shampoo and conditioner. So sad."
22489,1,Positive,This shampoo brought my dandruff back :(. I loved how the old total care shampoo smelled. Will try another brand now.
22490,1,Positive,"I used to absolutely love this shampoo conditioner! My favorite part was the smell! It was phenomenal! I would get compliments on my hair everyday saying my hair smelt delicious! When I purchased this new formula I was so Dissappointed. The scent was completely different, and as a woman with oily hair, this product weighed my hair down. I will not be repurchasing this product again. Now on the search for a new, great-smelling shampoo."
22491,1,Positive,"I must have found his gem right before they changed the formula like everyone in the 1-star section has mentioned. When I first discovered Clear, I felt like I had finally found my dream shampoo. There was no weight after I washed my hair. It was extremely healthy feeling and looking, and it smelled AMAZING. That is a thing of the past. Around March of this year, y'all must've launched your new formula, because my hair has been awful ever since. It feels greasy even after I style it, an hour or two after it has been washed. I had to buy clarifying shampoo to use to remove the buildup that your product has left on my hair. I would love to be a customer, but this new formula is bad, and I'm not the only one saying it. Please listen to your customers and bring back the old formula so we can all go back to having wonderful looking, and smelling, hair!"
22492,1,Positive,The new formula is not working. I bought one bottle and will not buy another. The new and improved has done nothing for my hair. It has caused dry scalp and skin irritation. Please bring back the original formula.
22493,1,Positive,I really miss your old scent been buying it for ever because of it I always got compliments. Got people to change to this shampoo and conditioner. Always had that scent all day long really miss the scent
22494,1,Positive,"Not a fan of the new formula, and particularly despise the new scent. This was the only shampoo conditioner I purchased for the past 4 years, and would have continued to do so if they hadn't changed it. I never write reviews but felt compelled to in hopes they would bring back the original. Until that happens, I'm forced to shop for a different brand because formula aside, I honestly can't stand the scent of the new shampoo conditioner."
22495,1,Positive,"I've been a clear lover for a while now, it was the only shampoo I bought because it didn't give me dandruff and the biggest reason I bought was because it smelt AMAZING! Everything was perfect (p.s I used only strong lengths shampoo and conditioner) until no store sells them anymore and they only sell the newer 24/7 bottles and I just can't stand the new smell..They've lost me as a customer because of this. :/"
22498,1,Positive,"As a long time user of this shampoo I was extremely disappointed to find the new formula is unusable for me. The old formula had a fantastic scent that was light and clean. Certain flowery scents give me migraines, so scent is a big factor for me in hair products. The new version is heavily scented and intolerable for me. The old formula left my hair clean, shiny, and manageable. Two days of the new formula left my hair heavy and greasy. Please bring back the old formula, otherwise you've lost a customer. :-("
22500,1,Positive,I do not like the new formula...I loved the old Clear Total care formula and scent. Please go back to this or at least have it as an option for purchase!
22501,1,Positive,"Use to love this line. However, since the new formula since September, my head has itched non stop."
22502,1,Positive,"This use to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner, It made my hair look and feel like I just walked out of the salon. I would get compliments on how great my hair smelled several times a day. People would often ask me what I was wearing that smelled so good and I would always reply with a smile It's my hair. Then I purchased this new formula and scent and instantly noticed the difference. My hair was weighted down and looked greasy and there was no beautiful scent. I've switched shampoos since and can't seem to find one that makes my hair look as good or smell as good as this shampoo once did. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD SCENT AND FORMULA. PLEASE!!!!"
22503,1,Positive,"Used the old formula for several years, people would compliment the way my hair smelled and looked all the time! The new formula leaves my hair weighed down and is just not the same. I'm sad that I now have to try to find a new shampoo that I will be happy with again."
22504,1,Positive,The new coconut scent is nowhere near as fabulous as the original scent. It is highly disappointing. Please bring back the old formula.
22506,1,Positive,I really don't like the new coconut smell. Please bring back the wonderful scent back for us. Obviously I am not the only one like that smell. I just bought 3 bottles of shampoo and 2 conditioner and discovered the smell has been changed to a coconut one. It really disappointed me with the smell and I am gonna return it. Sad to say that I am not going to repurchase it unless the wonderful scent being brought back :(

22510,1,Positive,"I have used CLEAR Total care shampoo and conditioner every since it hit the shelves and was very pleased with the product. It left my hair frizz free, light and not weighed down smelly great. Since the new formula has been released, my hair is weighed down and the new fragrance is horrible."
22513,1,Positive,Am very displeased with the new formula. The scent doesn't last in my hair like before. I wished you all would switch back to the old formula or make both so we can choose which one we want to buy
22515,1,Positive,"Use to love this product and would get compliments on how good my hair would smell.. The new formula weights down my hair, makes it oily and makes you smell like you bathed in tanning lotion.. please bring back the old formula!"
22516,1,Positive,"This new formula dried out my hair. After 2 years of using this product and promoting it, I will no longer use it or promote it unless it's changed back to the old ingredients."
22517,1,Positive,Clear Scalp Hair Therapy: Intensive Nourishment Balm. This is a very bad cheap product. I used this therapy for the first time and this wax like thing got permanently stuck to my hairs. I tried this product yesterday for the first time and after that I washed my hairs more than 20 times within this 24 hours. but I did not get success to reduce wax like thing is from my hair. I am so upset because prior to applying this product my hair was too smooth and it very long. I love my hair and really do not want to cut my hairs just because of this cheap product. I do not understand what to do. my recommandation to all who love their hair please do not even think of trying this Scalp therapy. its bad very bad. ( (
22518,1,Positive,I received a sample of this shampoo. And at first loved the smell and consistency of the product and the lather. But as some days went by. I noticed my head starting to get itchy. Was bad enough thaty scalp got dry and scabby in some spots. I'm usually not sensitive or have problems with any shampoo but for some reason this gave me a reaction. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
22520,2,Positive,Love the smell of this product but after washing my hair in the morning by the afternoon my hair was oily like I never had washed it.
22521,2,Positive,I was using total hair care clear for years. Tried the new formula and hate it. It was the best shampoo ever until it was changed.
22522,2,Positive,"I used to use the original Clear shampoo and conditioner and believed it to be a godsend, that's how great it was! My hair always stayed looking amazing and I was able to say goodbye to my dry scalp and flakes. Unfortunately, this new 24/7 formula leaves my hair greasy and flat the day after I wash it. I've also been dealing with an itchy scalp and dandruff. Please bring back the original formula for the sake of the brand and all of these dissatisfied customers."
22523,2,Positive,"I used to love this shampoo until you changed the formula. I don't care for the new scent, almost smells musty. My hair doesn't feel as clean with this new formula. The only thing that didn't change is it still makes my hair shiny. However, I will not buy it anymore. Please listen to all these reviews asking for the old formula back. I have not yet found a substitute for the old formula. It was the best shampoo and conditioner."
22524,2,Positive,"I used to marvel at how clean and bouncy my hair was....sorry not any more. I am thoroughly confused about what shampoo to switch to. I previously recommended this old one to my daughter and she promptly returned her purchase to me! My hair is over greasy with oily build up, and I am washing it constantly. Flat top is not something to be pleased about!"
22525,2,Positive,"I have used this product for a long time and loved it. Now it has coconut milk in it, and I can't find any of the clear products in any of the stores. It's so disappointing that I c s nth find it anywhere!! My daughter and I have used total care and we don't care of the added coconut milk, and the scent has changed. Please bring back the original products!! Shampoos and conditioners!!!! I can't recommend these products anymore because we c s nth find them anywhere!!! These ratios g are based on the original products"
22526,2,Positive,"When I first found this shampoo it was a holy grail for me. I loved it! Since they have changed it, it's not the same. I added it to my shampoo graveyard of things that don't work. Sad, I had finally found something that worked for my greasy hair. Made my hair so soft and manageable I didn't even have to style it. I don't buy this anymore, still in search of something that works as good as this used to."
22527,2,Positive,"Started using Clear a few years ago and fell IN LOVE. Have been searching everywhere for the type that I used to use with no luck. Why is there no longer a Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner The best shampoo I've ever used and it gets taken away. I had never received more compliments on my natural hair than when I was using the Clear Volumizing shampoo and conditioner. REALLY disappointed and would love if you could bring that back. For someone with fine, shiny hair, we dont need moisture, hydration. I have tried the color and heat conquerer and my hair never got fully clean and the scent is no longer desirable. HELP! BRING BACK THE BEST SHAMPOO EVER! I will buy it for life. My reviews will be of the current product line as is. This review would be the complete opposite, had the old formula not gone away."
22528,2,Positive,"This new formula is not anywhere near as good as the old. The old left my hair smelling great and so shiny and soft for 4-5 days. The new formula softens my hair but not as much as the old and it does smell good after freshly washed but by the end of the next day, smells as if it was not washed for days and is knotted and dry on the ends. Also I was very limited on the type of shampoo/conditioner I could use as some of the new formulas contain algae, cactus, or berry extract all of which I am allergic too, so maybe this hair type shampoo/conditioner is wrong for my hair type, but was the only one I had to choose from due to allergens. I used the old formula for 4 years and it was the only thing that made my hair beautiful and grew from very short to extremely long using the old formula and it was healthy. The new formula doesn't seem to benefit my hair nearly as much. Sad to say but I will no loner be using this product in this formula, please bring back the old formula."
22529,2,Positive,I've used the clear shampoo and conditioner for several years and with the new formula I became completely allergic with a rash from head to toe. I had to go on prednisone for the rash because it was unbearably itchy and raised bumps all over me. Can you please tell me what's in the new one that wasn't in the old one so I can know what it is I have to watch out for. Thank you in advance
22530,2,Positive,"This product looked soooo good, so I decided to try the 2 dollar sample shampoo. Good thing I didn't buy the whole thing because it made my hair so oily, dry and just felt gross. It might only be my hair, since other people seemed to have liked it, but I hate it. The one thing I do like is that it has a very good fragrance, but I wouldn't use it again. My hair actually looked oilier than before I had washed it."
22531,2,Positive,"I used to love this shampoo until you changed the formula. I don't care for the new scent, almost smells musty. My hair doesn't feel as clean with this new formula.

22538,2,Positive,"I used this for the first time last night and my husband walked into the bedroom and said, I can smell your shower all the way out in the garage! Not a bad shampoo, but fragrance isn't haircare. Take it down a notch with the scent."
22539,2,Positive,"When I started using Clear shampoo and conditioner I loved it. My hair felt softer and smoother. After a couple weeks, though, I started to notice some flakes. I have never had dandruff in my entire life so this freaked me out a little bit. The only thing in my hair care routine I had changed was the shampoo and conditioner, so I figured it was that, but wasn't absolutely positive. I stopped using it and used Head Shoulders for a few weeks before going back to my regular shampoo. Immediately my hair went back to normal (and was flake-free). After a couple months I decided to try Clear again, since I had a lot left. After about three days I started to get flakes again. My hair is on the dry side, so maybe this makes sense, but as I mentioned, this is the first shampoo/conditioner I have ever tried that caused flakes."
22724,1,Positive,All the bags of chips had burst open and were all over the box. I had to go buy more chips. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
22725,1,Positive,Purchased for one of my boys. They love them always have!
22881,1,Positive,I did not like this items strong scent ... not for me. I will stick to the Kiss My Face Pure Olive Oil Fragrance Free Soap.
22884,1,Positive,could have left this one on the shelf but it had a great box
22885,1,Positive,"This movie is much worse that expected. The 1997 Broderick movie is much better. The producers went back to the popular Japanese format that were great for teenagers, but just doesn't work for adults."
22893,1,Positive,I missed this at the movies and to be honest I'm glad I did. I guess with such a classic to work from I expected far more then just 2 hours of total cgi.. Guess I was expecting to much to hope there was alittle story line. Think I sell it on Amazon as used and be on my way
22898,1,Positive,you have good actors participating in a movie without drama.
22901,1,Positive,great movie but what I revieved was totally wrong...I ordered a blu ray steelbook and got a DVD ???wow what a mess to fix as the store and on the telephone..but it got solved..
22903,1,Positive,I like Godzilla movies and grew up with them. So I was excited to see this. The best part of the blu ray was the extra footage that best buy offers. Although I don't think it's exclusive?
22904,1,Positive,"I 've seem a few Godzilla movies, the previous one I though was pretty good, this last one is as bad as it can be, it was just a waste of money, I am glad that I did not go to the theatre"
22906,1,Positive,Got it because it was 3DOther wise would have got the bootleg for $2
22910,1,Positive,"First rate actors (Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, David Straitharn) in a gloomy, over-dramatized monster movie. The big guy gets surprisingly little screen time, and duplicating the 50's rubber suit Godzilla in CGI seems misguided."
22911,1,Positive,This movie is boring. You are better of renting it than owing it. There is been many remakes of Godzilla and this offers nothing better
22913,1,Positive,I usually love science fiction and this type of movie but found this one very boring. My husband and kids liked it though.
22915,1,Positive,Not crazy about the movie. The old Godzilla was so much better. Wouldn't watch it again
22919,1,Positive,Description says this is a MetalPak (steelbook). This is just a regular plastic blu-ray case. Movie is great but this gets the poor rating for a an incorrectly advertised product
22921,2,Positive,REMINDED ME OF THE GODZILLA MOVIES OF OLD. KIND OF SLOW AND NOT MUCH OF GODZILLA HIMSELF IN THE MOVIE.
22922,2,Positive,"This movie was slow to develop, didn't catch my interest through the characters, and in general was disappointing. The best parts were the special effects and fight scenes toward the end of the movie. It's okay for a one time watch."
22923,2,Positive,It was an OK film. A little toooo long winded. Need to find BETTER actors in these type of films in my opinion.
22924,2,Positive,Godzilla was great and Brian Cranston was great. There wasn't enough Godzilla in it. long and boring not enough monsters.
22926,2,Positive,I'm a fan of the original Godzilla and the efforts to revamp this property just fall short in my opinion
22931,2,Positive,"Not bad, could use better directing and more backstory with the types of monsters. The fight scenes were pretty cool, it just took the entire movie before seeing them."
22932,2,Positive,"I guess I miss the cheesy black and white Japanese versions of Godzilla from my youth, this was nothing close to that. The newest or relatively closest version of Godzilla that is worth anything is the parody that is mentioned in ""Austin Powers Gold Member"". The Lt in the movie had way too many close calls and still was able to make it home without getting hurt. And Godzilla saves the day in the end? Really? I dozed twice during the movie and had to wake myself up to finish it. I tried to watch completely, but it is what it is."
22933,2,Positive,the movie wasnt a real godzilla movie. didnt show him enough. the other to monsters were shown a lot more
22934,2,Positive,Movie is good ..... the 3d version looks like a conversion to 3d... really dark in some spots actually hard to see...i would have bought the blue ray if nwe it was this dark.
22935,2,Positive,it was to long no good shots of Godzilla and dark the old was better
22936,2,Positive,I lost interest in the first 15 minutes. Was this supposed to be a continuation of the 1st Godzilla?
22939,2,Positive,Im surprised how many people liked this movie! It's really not enough of a Godzilla movie for me to recommend. Do yourself a favor and buy the Criterion original or the box set with all the Godzilla movies for the same price!
22943,2,Positive,"the movie it self was fine , I guess my expectations of the movie content were not met"
22946,2,Positive,"I am a Godzilla fan. I wanted to see this at the movie theater but was not able. The story line was very good, what blew it for me was I could not make out all of the night scenes. They were filmed or transfered to dark, only shadows could be seen."
22948,2,Positive,"This movie had some great special effects, but is was really just OK. The premise of a cover up was an interesting way to start the story, but then Cranston is gone and there was not nearly enough action with the title character. It ends up being a weak love story."
22949,2,Positive,"Movie was average, had some good action scenes, but a lot of the effects were done on the dark side and harder to see. Was hoping for more of a good ""bad"" movie, but was just okay. Dialog and story had potential but never really took off."
22951,2,Positive,The movie could have been much better if the writers and the directors would have focus more on the original Godzilla movie. I was kind of disappointed in the movie all in all.
22953,2,Positive,"The movie was ok, but not what I was expecting. Would not be a movie I will watch again."
22954,2,Positive,"Not the best Godzilla movie. I understand the throwback to early Japanese cinema, where Godzilla would take on another monster jeopardizing mankind but to be honest I started to fall asleep during the last forty minutes. Borrow it or wait until it shows up on cable. Only add it to your collection if you are a big G fan."
22955,2,Positive,"Seemed a bit of a let down to have such amazing graphics and action, yet very lacking in storyline. The point of watching a movie has to have some meat to keep the audience interested, seems this one didn't quite follow-thru."
22956,2,Positive,No as moving as the original. Too much of a lot of nothing.
22957,2,Positive,This was a pretty good remake because this movie took more time to develop the story. I was a bit disappointed on the lack of story telling about the star Godzilla but it wasn't bad.
22960,2,Positive,Movie was not as good as the previews led one to believe. Would not have bought it had I known how dragged out it was.
22962,2,Positive,"The original is still the best because it is ""so bad it is good"". The action was great of course but it got boring very fast."
22965,2,Positive,"blu ray quality is good but movie is ok,to much talketive scenes"
22966,2,Positive,"I found the movie Godzilla just OK, not great, not fantastic, just OK. Thought Cranston would have had a larger role."
22967,2,Positive,I had high hopes for this movie and when i finally watched it the movie was a big let down.
22968,2,Positive,I wasn't very impressed with this movie because I felt like it didn't show very much about Godzilla. However we did enjoy the story and great affects.
22969,2,Positive,Movie was not that good (I fell asleep during it). Also movie picture was very dark. I would not recommend.
22970,2,Positive,"Good one time movie, I will prefer renting this movie not worth having that on your collection"
22972,2,Positive,to much and the old movie has better story. to much activety
22977,2,Positive,"It was 1hr & 26 minutes before you got to see Godzilla for more than a few seconds. Then the main theme which seemed to be Godzilla was too long in coming, the fight was ok but you had to wait for any real action and i had lost interest by then.Very disappointing.Wish i had not spent the money!!!!!"
26226,2,Positive,Needs less sodium. But ok.
26261,1,Positive,Like others have commented the quality of the transfer was not that great. Probably could have gotten just the same quality from a upscaled DVD. Also like one of the other posters said you have to turn on subtitles otherwise you don't know what is going on through half the movie. The DVD automatically subtitles the foreign language parts while this one doesn't. Basically I wish I hadn't spent $10 on it.
26262,2,Positive,"Ok, for everybody out there. Stargate is a great movie. If you haven't seen it, you need to. If you have, then you already know what I'm talking about. My purpose here, though, is not to tout a great movie, but blast Lion's Gate for releasing such a poor quality product. I own a good collection of Blu-Ray movies and they all look great on my 1080p Mitsubishi on a PS3. Stargate, however, looks like they ripped a VHS cassette tape and put it on a Blu-Ray disk. Sad. So, for my opinion, I say that your money is better spent on the DVD version. It will be cheaper and look the same."
26263,2,Positive,"The ""extended cut"" looks great. The original cinematography was wonderful. The original music at times gets a bit repetitive, but I imagine that not many people have John Williams talent. Regardless, the most annoying thing about this version is the complete lack of subtitles for the many foreign languages spoken (German, ""ancient Egyptian"", etc). The only way to get any subtitling (and still much of the subtitles is not there) is to turn on either the English or Spanish subtitles. On the DVD I rented, the subtitles were there just for the foreign languages, leaving the English un-subbed. It wouldn't be so bad, except that this is a Blu-Ray, for which you're paying extra. You expect a little bit of continuity between the movies on different formats. I say, stick with the standard DVD version."
26264,2,Positive,"True fans of 'Stargate' will want to bypass this Blue-Ray disc and stick with the much better 2-disc special edition dvd that came out several years ago, had both the theatrical and director's cuts of the film, as well as several bonus features oddly not seen here on this new so-called 'next generation' release."
26450,1,Positive,"The first time I used in my infant, he rubbed his eyes and cried. Have never used it again for him. Do yourself a favor and buy something else for an infant or toddler that is tear free."
26456,1,Positive,"I literally have no idea why a product for babies and children would not be tearless. I have sworn by Aveeno products for years for both of my children's eczema. But within 20 minutes of application, and for hours after, both my 3 year old and 3 month old were screaming over this spf getting in there eyes. Frankly, I'm furious. I expected better from this brand. Trashing this ASAP."
26458,1,Positive,"When someone slaps the word BABY on a product, you assume it's baby friendly! I just went through the fiasco of a SCREAMING baby because it is not eye gentle! Every mom knows how hard it is to wash something out of a baby's eyes! Washing made it even worse because when you wash it, it starts acting like soap and gets worse! How is a baby supposed to go swimming and/or sweat without this stuff washing into their eyes ADVERTISING MILD AS WATER IS SUCH A LIE! Last time I checked, water didn't burn my eyes unless it was chlorine or salt water! Either case, false advertising! Granted, there is a tiny section on the back that said to keep out of eyes. I don't know about you, when you have a squirming child... You hardly take the time to read the back carefully unless you so happen to be next to the darn bottle while using the bathroom. However, in this case, I didn't go squirting sunscreen in my child's eyes or run it near the eyes. I simply applied the lotion on his face (as recommended by doctors) and any EXPOSED BODY PARTS which in turn, includes his HANDS. Which makes sense unless a parent plans on sending a child out with gloves at all seasons of the year! I admit to poor judgement on my part on not thinking it through clearly. However, as I mentioned earlier on, when one slaps the words baby and mild as water, one assumes it is gentle for ALL PARTS OF THE BABY including the EYES! I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND! However, I can make sound judgement that as far as skin use, it is gentle... But after dealing with a screaming baby and struggling to wash it out for 10 minutes, then having the baby fall asleep after the fiasco because of exhaustion, followed by having to wait an additional hour before continuing my plans, I would say this product is an inconvenience to have. It wasn't even his nap time! My suggestion is to do more research and find a better product that is truly baby safe, in all spectrums worthy of using the label BABY. Truly, One PO'ed and Distressed Mother"
26459,1,Positive,"I use a lot of Aveeno products so did not think in the slightest I'd have to worry about their baby sunscreen being unsafe. We starting using this on our baby and noticed every time we were outside she got very watery eyes and we couldn't figure why. After a couple applications, we realized the eye watering only occured when we applied the sunscreen. Turns out it was stinging her skin so she was rubbing her face and then her eyes making them water! The eyes stopped watering when we changed brands. Do not recommend!"
26462,1,Positive,"I tend to have sensitive skin, and I enjoy using natural products, so I thought this product would be the perfect choice. I started to slowly break out in hives after using this. It took me several days to figure out what was going on- I was almost convinced that I had bed bugs! I went to urgent care and they had me take prednisone, pepcid, and zyrtec for five days. I had hives on my face, neck, chest, arms, and I was on my second week at a new job..."
26463,1,Positive,"I bought this to use myself as a daily moisturizer, thinking it would be gentler and more hydrating than the adult version. Every time I put it on my face burns. I've never experienced this with any other product. Why does it burn"
26466,1,Positive,I accidentally bought the Continuous Protection instead of Natural Protection and after two uses my daughter's cheeks and neck were covered in eczema breakouts. We used Natural Protection all summer last year and this never occurred.
26469,1,Positive,"I have very sensitive skin and figured Aveeno Baby would be the right choice for sunscreen. After two uses, both resulting in large red welted areas on my chest I realized it's the sunscreen. Fine on arms but on my chest it's a no go."
26471,1,Positive,"My 6 year old daughter has sensitive skin, and after using last week, her face broke out in patches of very red, rough dry chapped places, like eczema. i had to put aquaphor on her patches for days until they cleared up. her chest and upper arms had a dry-type pink rash too. Im not going to be able to use this on her while at the beach for a week, or she will be covered in rash."
26476,1,Positive,"I tried this stuff for my 18-month old who has very dry and eczema preone skin. It was recommended on a website for sensitive skin, but I do NOT recommend using it. She broke out in small dots/pimples a few hours after using this product. The following day it was more of a rash. Still looking for something more mild."
26478,1,Positive,"I started to apply it on my little one and she rubbed her eyes, immediately they started tearing and she began crying. I also noticed that it started flaking off around her face and neck.Like the other guy said look like a bunch of lint. we went simming and after 40min dryed her off and reapplyed shortly after being back in the water the sun screen started dripping down her face and just running off her like water. I will never use this again. Not what I expected form Aveeno. I love there baby body wash and baby lotion they are usually very good. Don't put your baby through the tears."
26479,1,Positive,"My 6 year old daughter has sensitive skin, and after using last week, her face broke out in patches of very red, rough & dry chapped places, like eczema. i had to put aquaphor on her patches for days until they cleared up. her chest and upper arms had a dry-type pink rash too.

26491,1,Positive,"I have very sensitive skin and figured Aveeno Baby would be the right choice for sunscreen.After two uses, both resulting in large red welted areas on my chest I realized it's the sunscreen.Fine on arms but on my chest it's a no go."
26494,1,Positive,"I started to apply it on my little one and she rubbed her eyes, immediately they started tearing and she began crying. I also noticed that it started flaking off around her face and neck.Like the other guy said look like a bunch of lint. we went simming and after 40min dryed her off and reapplyed shortly after being back in the water the sun screen started dripping down her face and just running off her like water. I will never use this again. Not what I expected form Aveeno. I love there baby body wash and baby lotion they are usually very good. Don't put your baby through the tears."
26496,1,Positive,"I bought this to use myself as a daily moisturizer, thinking it would be gentler and more hydrating than the adult version. Every time I put it on my face burns. I've never experienced this with any other product. Why does it burn???"
26499,1,Positive,I wish I could give this 1 star. This sunscreen has now caused 2 total meltdowns with my toddler after he rubbed his eyes and got it in there (I should have learned the first time). We just left the park after a 45 minute crying fit that had to involve a police officer that was standing by to help watch my running car as I tried in vain to wash it out of his eyes in a water fountain. Absolute garbage.
26501,1,Positive,"Bought the sunscreen. Didn't like it. Baby's skin does not absorb it, also I wish I had checked the ingredients before ordering.. it's not very children friendly"
26503,1,Positive,"I literally have no idea why a product for babies and children would not be tearless.I have sworn by Aveeno products for years for both of my children's eczema. But within 20 minutes of application, and for hours after, both my 3 year old and 3 month old were screaming over this spf getting in there eyes. Frankly, I'm pissed. I expected better from this brand.Trashing this ASAP."
26508,1,Positive,It claims to be natural on Amazon - I was searching specifically for healthier sun screen for my little cousins.This one has parabens in it. Please be aware
26509,1,Positive,"Label states mild as water which is untrue. After applying this sunscreen on my 11 month old he was crying, the area around his lips was red, and he had red bumps on his back. I immediately put him in the bath and washed this trash off of him.After visiting the Aveeno website I saw a 2 1/2 star rating for this product along with horror stories of this product causing severe reactions.I would not recommend this product and I plan on calling Aveeno."
26510,1,Positive,My daughter had ezcema has a young baby but it has been cleared up for many months now. My daughter is now 10 months and hasn't had any problems with honest sunscreen or other natural kinds. I bought this thinking it would be fine but she had a horrible reaction to it! I have now thrown out the bottle.
26511,1,Positive,"When we opened it is not solid, it is completely melt and pour like water.All the liquid fall in one go.My recommendation never buy online sun creams."
26514,1,Positive,"When I used this product on my child she broke out into hives everywhere it touched her skinand she was crying in pain. It was a very tense half hour where we had to work to wash off this waterproof product. After this happened my sister-in-law immediately asked what we had used and she said her daughter had experience the same reaction to this product from Aveeno. The claim that this is as gentle as water is a complete fabrication - we use so many Aveeno products in our home because of skin sensitivities and I was very let down by this product and upset I had relied on this company I trusted to tell us the truth that this was specifically formulated for babies. After this happened I compared the ingredients to my own sunscreen and found all of the active ingredients were the same as my own, adult, sunscreen from another company. We have since switched to the Honest Company 100 zinc oxide sunscreen."
26517,1,Positive,Used this product on my one year old who has fair skin. He developed eczema in all his creases/joints. Do not use this product on your baby if they have sensitive or eczema prone skin. For the same amount of money (14 Canadian) you can go online and buy a much better product. Do your research!
26518,1,Positive,"I bought this thinking aveeno was a gentle brand. After first use baby had rash and enough big spots that daycare refused to take her until I saw a doctor because they thought she had chicken pox. I wasn't completely sure it was the sunscreen until the next weekend when I used it on myself because I found myself outside in full sun one afternoon and that's all I had with me, now I have the same bumps on my hands...I will be throwing this out! I'd rather use my own sunscreen on baby than this horrible baby product."
26519,1,Positive,I order sunblock not sunscreen I can buy sunscreen anywhere. I been looking for sunblock in many stores and I couldn't find it. that why I try online and I received sunscreen . Not fair
26521,1,Positive,"so i purchased this product to use on my face (not paying attention to the ingredients) because most sunscreens make my face burn (not like sunburn, like chemical sensitive skin burn). my face starting stinging sooo badly right after application! i looked at the ingredients... oxobenzene. there's no way i would put this on a baby! for the same price you can find a nice organic sunscreen"
26525,1,Positive,"I was going through baby sunscreens on the shelf, checking ingredients and discovered that Aveeno Baby sunscreen contained Ethylparaben and Methylparaben. I avoided purchasing this product all together. Aveeno Sun Natural Protection Baby SPF 50 Stick, 0.5 Ounce might be a better choice and is included in the Environmental Working Group's Best Sunscreen list. ..."
26526,1,Positive,"I have 15 month old twins with pasty white skin. They need sunscreen to protect them daily during the summer. I used this sunscreen for approx. 2 weeks before I started noticing eczema on both of their faces, arms and legs. The last time I used it, it caused a red, raised bumpy rash on my one girl's legs. I stopped using it once I put two and two together and have switched to a hypo-allergenic brand that seems to be working well."
26527,1,Positive,"This contains oxybenzone - what more do you need to know There are a lot of other sunscreens on the market that are safe, including other Aveeno products. There is no need to buy this one."
26529,1,Positive,"My 20 month old broke out in a rash all over her beautiful face after using this sunscreen! Needless to say, I checked the sunscreen on the Environmental Working Group and it made the HALL OF SHAME!!! As did a couple of other baby friendly sunscreens. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!! ..."
26532,1,Positive,"The lotion was not the quality that I have come to expect from Aveeno. Bought 2 bottles and in both the lotion was separated and no mater how much we would try to get it to mix, it wouldn't. During the time that we had it, it was never exposed to extreme temperatures. We went ahead and tried to use and it caused a rash on my daughter's face. We had ordered this about 1 month prior to needing to use it and by the time we realized the quality of the product, Amazon would not accept a return...."
26537,1,Positive,"We purchased Aveeno Baby Sunblock thinking it would be good for our baby since we use their lotion and bath products. That being said--when we first put it on my son, he started blinking, rubbing his eyes and crying. His eyes started turning red and he was super fussy (not typical).We thought maybe he got some in his eyes (as in larger amounts) so we tried again and same thing happened--he hated it and his eyes turned red and he kept rubbing them.We will no longer be using this on my son--I will however, use it for myself since it doesn't seem to bother my skin (I'll use on my shoulders/arms)."
26538,1,Positive,"I ordered this without looking at the ingredients (I know). And after I received it, even started using it. It has a really nice consistency and then discovered why. It has 3 kinds of parabens. Parabens have been linked to both breast cancer and endocrine disruption. While Aveeno might say the science is not all in - why take the risk I'd rather choose a product that doesn't have that potential danger. I found the Babyganics sunscreens Babyganics Cover Up Baby Sunscreen For Face and Body 50 SPF, 6-Ounce (Pack of 2) that you can also sign up for the subscription for without parabens. They are on the list of the cosmetic database/Skin deep's list of safe sunscreens. ..."
26541,2,Positive,just start to use couple months ago....so far its good and statisfied......still using it for my baby and for myself too......lets see how it works....good luck
26542,2,Positive,"I bought Aveeno Baby sunscreen to use on my son who is prone to eczema. When I used this product occasionally at home, his skin did not seem to break out unusually. However after using this for a week straight at the beach, he had patches of eczema all over his arms and legs. The skin on his entire body felt dried out. While it provides an adequate sunscreen, I cannot recommend this product for everyday use due to the reaction my son had."

26547,2,Positive,"My kids had a reaction to eat. Specially my 18 months old baby, who got a rash and eventually a dry skin peeling. We have been using aveeno products for years, and this is the first time we had any problem with it."
26549,2,Positive,My 2 year old daughter cried with red eyes every time after I put it on her face because she rubbed it into her eyes.
26551,2,Positive,I thought this was working okay until I noticed my daughter was getting tan even when we put it on. I noticed today it rinses right off as soon as we hit the water. What a waste. Get something that is waterproof.Also I just heard the news on cancer associated parabens. Better be safe and use something without them.
26553,2,Positive,"My toddler, with not so sensitive skin, broke out from this sunscreen."
26556,2,Positive,I bought this as it was rated very well but my son's face burned. I even put it on a 1/2 hour before being exposed to the sun and reapplied throughout the day.
26557,2,Positive,"My sister bought this because her skin is very very sensitive, even many sunblocks that claim to be organic irritate her skin. She usually buys baby sunblock in order to deal with her skin. Compared to the normal aveeno sunblock, also with 55 spf, the only difference is the smell. The baby sunblock has no smell. However, my sister DID end up being allergic to it even though it says 'gentle as water'. This isn't a big deal to the two of us being that I just took it off her hands and use it as a normal sunblock, but I would NOT rub this on a baby. My sister got totally red from it. Super disappointed here, because she can't find a sunblock that works for her and she burns easily.. but I can't say it doesn't work for normal skin being that I've used it and it does work just fine for me."
26832,2,Positive,"I was really excited to receive this cart, the picture looks great and would fit our space well. Unfortunately, the quality (per the price) is not great, and the not all the pieces fit together flush, making it generally unsteady. There are 1/2 gaps between the lag and table where they don't fit together, and the knobs don't fit in all the holes. I would return it to the store, but there would be NO WAY I would be able to disassemble and bring back tot he store in the original carton. I would pay a little more for something that goes together nicely!"
26833,2,Positive,"this cart looks REALLY nice and the functionality is great. The problem I have with it is the quality. Putting it together was a nightmare, not because it should have been hard but because the manufacturing is poor at best. I had to use a drill to make holes bigger to attach parts because the existing holes were so poorly drilled and didn't match up. Once I got it together I was happy with it and how it looks just beware the quality is pretty awful."
26857,1,Positive,"But my wife loves him, thus purchasing the CD. I hate supporting this guy, but you know what they say, Happy Wife, Happy Life!"
26859,2,Positive,"My least favorite aldean album, probably gonna just buy individual songs on itunes"
27126,1,Positive,What have you done to Vicks I have used this product for many years and it is not the same nor does it work as well. The vapor feeling is gone and it does not clear my head like it did in the past.
27127,1,Positive,"My husband picked this up for me when I was sick and didn't realize it was lemon scented. It was effective but the smell was very strong and left me feeling like I needed to go clean something rather than relaxed. The smell of Vicks is a bit nostalgic and brings comfort. The lemon scent is not relaxing at all. If they want to try new scents, maybe lavender would be better"
27128,1,Positive,"Like others who have posted, something has definitely changed with VapoRub. It doesn't smell as strong. It has been posted that the formula hasn't changed but all of us couldn't be wrong. The nose knows. And while I'm writing, please bring back VapoCream. It was so much more pleasant to use. Had I known it was going to be discontinued years ago I would have bought it by the case. Pat"
27130,1,Positive,"I've read a response from Vicks to another reviewer that stated there have not been any changes to the formula in recent times. However, there have obviously been changes since I used it years ago. I did not find it near as soothing nor as strong, so did not find the rub effective. It's also expensive for what it is, so I returned it to the store where I purchased it."
27132,1,Positive,"VICKS VAPORUB MADE IN MEXICO...YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD THAT YOU HAVE THIS PRODUCT MADE OUTSIDE THE U.S.A.THEN TURN IT AROUND TO SELL IT TO AMERICANS THAT ARE OUT OF WORK.YOU WANT TO CUT COSTS, WELL, CUT YOUR MANAGEMENT SALARIES AND FIRE ALL WHO DECIDED TO HAVE ANY OF YOR PRODUCTS MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES!"
27137,2,Positive,"what's happened to vapo rub i remember growing up as a child, when you used vapo rub at night or during the day the vapors would last longer and were strong enough to open you sinuses and chest and provide better breathing. you guys are really slipping with this weak stuff."
27223,1,Positive,"My daughter collects animated movies and she loved Cars, so thought this would be a great addition to her collection."
27224,1,Positive,"We all know that Disney releases great movies as their normal ""1st Tier"" offerings......Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, etc., and these are all great films. Then, they release great ""2nd Tier"" sequels like Toy Story 2, etc. which live up to the greatness of the first film. This was not one of those great ""2nd Tier"" Disney offerings. Instead, they milk films and release unnecessary sequels. This film was one of those unnecessary sequels that really fell short, a true ""3rd Tier"" offering."
27225,1,Positive,Very good flick.
27226,2,Positive,The sequel was not as good as the original. I was disappointed.
27227,2,Positive,This is a cute movie especially if you have little ones at home
27228,2,Positive,Entertaining lots of action packed stunts for the kids
28365,1,Positive,The cd was what I expected but the shipping wasn't great at all it shipped to the store and when I received the cd it was broken
28366,2,Positive,"I thought my grandson would like it, but not so much."
28394,1,Positive,"It's a very good quality product but the dimensions listed on the website are incorrect so I can't use it for what I was planning. So buying it, waiting for delivery, and returning to the store was unfortunately a waste of my time! The listed dimensions are:Product Depth (in.) 1.29Product Width (in.) 1.29Product Height (in.) 1.86Projection 1.86 inActual dimensions:Product Height: 1 5/16""Product Diameter: 1 3/4"""
28451,1,Positive,"Ordered a glider ottoman for my nursery, it took almost a month to arrive! Once it arrived the box was left outside the front door and it was clearly burnt. We opened it up and found that the fabric on the glider and ottoman was also burnt. Not sure where the fire was or why they bothered to deliver the damaged item. We had to arrange for ups to pick up the item for return and get a refund. Purchased the item from Babies R Us instead due to the HUGE inconvenience."
28454,1,Positive,I have had this set for eight months in my baby's room since we brought him home. With in a couple of months the squeeking started which was fixable with wd40. Now this glider is out of control skreetching with a big bump in the middle of the glide. It is really irratating when all you need to do is sit and rock your upset baby. So now we are waiting for our new rocker not a glider to be delivered. We search and found that even some of the expensive gliders have the same complaints which is why we are going with a rocker. Good Luck!
28456,1,Positive,"my husband purchased this product for me to use for nursing..it was easy to put together and only took about 20-30 minutes tops. it's a very beautiful chair and the colors are great. i was really impressed at first especially for the price. it did smell funny at first, but nothing fabreeze can't fix and i'm sure the rubbery smell would wear off after a couple weeks. HOWEVER the quality was very poor.. after only 2 days the chair broke! the first time my husband sat in it the chair made a creeking sound, but we figured it was breaking in since it was brand new and didn't think much of it. the next day when he sat in it and glided it made a loud pop and the bottom bars that glide broke. i wouldn't recommend this product it is very pretty, but not worth it and a waste of your money. i guess you get what you pay for. our local walmart did return it, but save you time and money and don't go through the hassle of having to take it apart and taking it back to the store."
28459,1,Positive,"This chair was nice when it was first purchased. My daughter was only two weeks old and the chair started to squeek! Now not only does it squeek, but there is a loud clunking sound and it isn't a gentle soothing glider! WD 40 will not work when the squeek is wood on wood...try baby powder! But only a quick not permant fix. I WOULD NEVER recommend this product to someone with a baby! Also not enough room for your arms and baby for nursing. I don't hardly use it anymore because of those reasons...it was a WASTE of money."
28460,1,Positive,When we originally got the Glider we were impressed by the color and the padding and such. Required minimal installation but we have regretted this purchase soon after. The glider squeaks so much that it is unbearable to use. No matter how much of WD40 we use it doesn't help. I would not recommend this Glider and we are going to purchase a Dutalier or a better glider soon.
28461,1,Positive,"Walmart did a great job, they deliver before the arrival time and the customer service was great, but i didn't like the glider and ottoman. The quality of the product is nice and well done, but it is really uncomfortable for me. You have to sit very straight......So, unfortunately I have returned this product 2 days after I received it."
28462,2,Positive,"Ok, I've waited over a year to write this review. I purchased this chair 12/2009 and have been using it since then about 5-8 times a day. This chair is a decent wood and a decent fabric. The cushions are pretty comfortable actually. The chair is SUPER easy to put together. If you're mechanically inclined you can do it yourself. Others may need assistance from a second person. Fairly easy to wipe down the fabric (covers are not removable). I have fallen asleep in it with my daughter in my arms prior to the squeaking issue starting, so it is really a fairly comfortable chair. What I didn't like: 6-12 weeks after I purchased this chair I started to have a lot of squeaking coming from the bottom bearings of the gliding portion of the chair. This might not be a huge deal for some people, but it's very loud. Especially, loud when you're trying to nurse a sleepy baby back to sleep and it keeps waking them up. I tried to adjust all of the bolts, tried WD-40, didn't fix the issue. I finally contacted customer service at Storkcraft after about 7 months of owning it. They did agree to send me a replacement base for the chair since it was still within the 12 month warranty period. Oh, and I am of normal height and weight, so being over a weight limit is not an issue. Upon receipt I removed the old base, attached the new base exactly as the instructions stated. Again, about 8 weeks after receiving this base I had the same problem. I let it go for about 12 weeks and contacted Storkcraft again just to let them know I was having issues again (even though I was now out of the warranty period). They said that they would as a courtesy send me another base, but any future bases would be at a charge to me. Which of course makes sense. I told them I wasn't expecting another base, just trying to inform them that the problem was not resolved and that maybe there's an issue with the production of the item. I have received the third base (second replacement) and have not installed it yet. I would like to say that this would be a good chair if it didn't have this obnoxious squeaking issue. However, to me that makes the chair almost not usable. It squeaks every single time I rock in it. So I really wouldn't recommend this chair because of the issues I had with it. I did think that everything else about it was fairly nice and definitely worth the price. But that's why I gave it a (2) star rating. Because I wasn't completely dissatisfied(1), but I wasn't neutral on it (3), nor was I happy(4) or ecstatic(5) about it. I read all of the reviews before I bought it and thought it was a good choice, so I thought I'd give my feedback for you to look over as well. Good luck in your decision!"
28463,2,Positive,"I purchased this item because of the high ratings it received. It is a beautiful chair to look at and it's really inviting but, it is very hard on my back. I thought it was just me but my daughter also found it to be too hard to sit in to watch a 1 1/2 hour movie. Do not buy this chair if you intend to use it for sitting in for long periods at a time."
28464,2,Positive,"We've had this glider for just under a year. I wish I would have saved my money for a more expensive set because the quality is just not there - it feels shaky, squeaks, the padding is rather thin, and it just not that comfortable, especially when you have to sit down for longer feedings. It also doesn't work for a taller person - my husband could not sit in it comfortably with our baby. The ottoman also did not work the best for comfortably propping up feet up - it seemed too low and would not stay in place. We ended up just not using it. The glider does the job, but is overall a disappointment."
28465,2,Positive,The chair was easy to assemble was a great piece for our living room. I loved rocking my baby to sleep until it started squeaking never stopped. The sound is so annoying won't go away.
28711,1,Positive,"product says 'cocoa butter solid'. what a joke- the first 3 ingredients are mineral oil, petrolalum, and parrafin. in fact according to the label, it has more fragrance in it than cocoa butter. It even contains corn oil !! I could have saved myself some money and time by buying a cheap candle and rubbing it on. Label shows a picture of a cocoa bean - it should have shown an oil rig and ear of corn !!! no wonder they don't show the ingredients in the ad - not even on the manufacturer's website.shame on Amazon for even allowing it to be catagorized with real cocoa butter products."
28713,2,Positive,"*Edited to add that the pictures of the ingredients label were not on the page when I bought this product.*This is by no means solid coca butter. It has *some* cocoa butter in it but it's a ways down the ingredients list. It is more mineral oil, petroleum. and paraffin which are the first three ingredients. It is very solid, like a candle. In fact, I dumped the tub over accidentally and the whole thing fell out of the tub in one solid piece. I picked it up and put it back in. It looks like a candle, yellow and nearly opaque. It is very greasy and very, very hard. You can't dip your finger into the tub and scoop some out. You have to sort of scrape the sides to get some of the waxy stuff out of there.On my skin, it is greasy. It has a great scent though I must say. I guess it's cocoa buttery. The fragrance is artificial. I bought this cream for my hands as they are really dry in the winter but this is way too greasy for use anytime but at night with gloves on. It does remove makeup on my face decently although it is certainly not my preferred method. It's not bad on my lips but has a strange taste. I am desperately trying to find a use for this stuff. I think that the description should be much clearer because this simply is NOT cocoa butter at all. It is misleading to label it that way. I have been using this Queen Helene .. stuff on my hands at night and also have used it to remove makeup, on my lips, and also around my eyes for a jolt of hydration but really, I don't know quite what to do with it. It is not what I expected and so hard and greasy. At least it was cheap!"
28747,2,Positive,Armor-all version of these wipes cleans stubborn dirt better.
28775,1,Positive,"This product is ridiculous. It indeed holds and sculpts firmly with a matte finish, but good luck getting it out of your hair. Days later and after multiple washes, my poor hair is left feeling tacky and clumpy- stiff like straw. As another review stated, 'stuck with chewing gum' would be a totally accurate comparison. This was my first styling purchase from L'Oreal and I expected so much more from such a leading name in hair care. How disappointing. Never again."
28780,1,Positive,"I needed something to help style my hair for work(bartender) and this looked like it would be able to keep my hair in one place without me having to adjust it during a shift at work. Unfortunately, like most others who have bought this problem, have had issues removing the product from their hair, just like I have. I WOULD NOT recommend anyone to use this product at all."
28781,2,Positive,The hold with this product is great but IT DOES NOT WASH OUT
28783,2,Positive,"I loved it. The ease of manipulation during styling, the hold, the texture, the finish... Everything you want for a piecey pixie.BUT it sticks tenaciously to the hair like tree sap or gum. So much so that it is impossible to wash off. For that, this first try might be my last if I can't find a way to still get back my clean hair at the end of the day."
28799,2,Positive,I wanted to rate it as 3 stars but it will not let me. Has a pleasant scent and is easier to rinse than most other powdered scrubs. It did not cut though the tub ring as well as I would have liked. But over all it did a good job on the lighter stuff. It just needs a little extra something added to help with cleaning tuff stuff.
28814,1,Positive,"I got these products as a sample for testing purposes through an app called influenster and I was really really excited to try this out, but I am highly sensitive to fragrance so basically anything with scent makes me break out... when I opened up the bottle it was way to scented for me to be able to use :/ please consider that for future products! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28815,1,Positive,I was so excited about receiving this free to use and write a review... my excitement ended there....in my opinion makes my roots more greasy and my ends dull. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
28816,1,Positive,"i didn't not like this product, i received it from influenster and was not a fan.. i felt like it didn't condition my ends very well and my hair didn't feel as soft as it would've with my other conditioner This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28817,1,Positive,I'm happy I got to try this courtesy of Influenster but I really didn't like it. It didn't condition my hair at all. Not worth purchasing. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
28818,1,Positive,"I wasn't too pleased with this conditioner, but I also wasn't too upset- it was just plain average. I did receive this product for free for reviewing purposes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28819,1,Positive,I got this to test out and review.. didn't really like the way my hair felt after.... my hair felt dry and caked with product... haven't used it since. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
28820,1,Positive,"When I got these products in the mail I was actually really excited about them! But once I used them I notice that they didn't really make a difference in my oily roots or my dry ends! On the contrary I feel like my roots became more oily and my hair and ends became extremely dry! I wasn't too happy with these products. Beware of your hair becoming very tangled!! (If you have curly hair). As far as the conditioner, it smelled kind of good actually and it felt like it conditioned my hair while I applied it in the shower. But out of the shower, my hair was a COMPLETELY different story! Very tangled and dry ends! *I received these products complimentary from Influenster but all the reviews are my own thoughts* This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28821,1,Positive,Bought the Extraordinary Clay Conditioner because I was told that the Power Moisture Hydrating Conditioner has been discontinued and this one replaced it. Do not like the new one at all. Hair isn't as shiny get huge knots in my hair when blow drying can totally feel the difference in the texture of my hair.
28822,1,Positive,I can see this working AMAZINGLY for someone with normal thickness and coarseness. Between the mask and shampoo it was too much for my already dry damaged ends. i did receive this product for free in exchange for a review however all opinions are my own. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
28823,1,Positive,"I wanted to love this product, but unfortunately it didn't work well with my hair. It helped with my oily roots, but it left my ends extremely dry.

28826,1,Positive,"I got these products as a sample for testing purposes through an app called influenster and I was really really excited to try this out, but I am highly sensitive to fragrance so basically anything with scent makes me break out... when I opened up the bottle it was way to scented for me to be able to use :/ please consider that for future products!

28827,1,Positive,"i didn't not like this product, i received it from influenster and was not a fan.. i felt like it didn't condition my ends very well and my hair didn't feel as soft as it would've with my other conditioner This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28828,1,Positive,"I wanted to love this product, but unfortunately it didn't work well with my hair. It helped with my oily roots, but it left my ends extremely dry.

28829,1,Positive,I got this to test out and review.. didn't really like the way my hair felt after.... my hair felt dry and caked with product... haven't used it since. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
28830,1,Positive,"I wasn't too pleased with this conditioner, but I also wasn't too upset- it was just plain average. I did receive this product for free for reviewing purposes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28831,1,Positive,I'm happy I got to try this courtesy of Influenster but I really didn't like it. It didn't condition my hair at all. Not worth purchasing. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
28832,1,Positive,I can see this working AMAZINGLY for someone with normal thickness and coarseness. Between the mask and shampoo it was too much for my already dry damaged ends. i did receive this product for free in exchange for a review however all opinions are my own. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
28833,1,Positive,"When I got these products in the mail I was actually really excited about them! But once I used them I notice that they didn't really make a difference in my oily roots or my dry ends! On the contrary I feel like my roots became more oily and my hair and ends became extremely dry! I wasn't too happy with these products. Beware of your hair becoming very tangled!! (If you have curly hair). As far as the conditioner, it smelled kind of good actually and it felt like it conditioned my hair while I applied it in the shower. But out of the shower, my hair was a COMPLETELY different story! Very tangled and dry ends! *I received these products complimentary from Influenster but all the reviews are my own thoughts* This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28834,1,Positive,I was so excited about receiving this free to use and write a review... my excitement ended there....in my opinion makes my roots more greasy and my ends dull. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

28836,2,Positive,"The shampoo was just okay to me. The packaging and smell is really nice but other than that I didn't see any real difference in my hair. I have quite thick and corse hair to begin with so it may not have been the product for me anyway. I don't have issues with oily scalp but I think people with this problem will appreciate this hair mask more than me.

28838,2,Positive,"I received this item free for testing from Influenster. After using the mask, and shampoo, my hair was pretty dry, and this conditioner did not help much. After I dried and styled my hair, it felt like hay! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28840,2,Positive,"This conditioner is fine, unremarkable, but not bad. Pleasant smell. Didn't feel heavy at all. Disclosure- I received this product free for testing purposes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28841,2,Positive,My hair usually curls very easily but after using this system I couldn't get my curl to stay the following day and my ends were frizzy- nothing my regular shampoo and conditioner couldn't fix the following day thank goodness. I still used dry shampoo the following morning so this system really wasn't worth it. I received this free in exchange for an honest review. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
28842,2,Positive,"I received this for free from influenster to review. This would be the best out of all three products i was sent to review from this line. The conditioner did make my curls shine, but i did add coconut oil while i was conditioning my hair. Still would NOT recommend this to girls with kinky curly hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28843,2,Positive,I got this product free and was very excited to try it. I've used it a couple of times now and my hair the day that I wash it is amazing but the next morning is very greasy. I don't like to wash my hair every day. This product boasts that it will prevent oily roots up to 48 hours. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
28844,2,Positive,"I tried out this whole set.i wanted it to work but the scent wasn't favorable and my hair felt really dry, hard and stiff after and I've always been so proud of my soft hair. I tried using this for a week or so but had to stop in fear that I was causing permanent damage to my hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28845,2,Positive,"I received this product as a set free for testing purposes. I used this set as soon as I could get my hands on it. Couldn't wait to use the entire set. The clay mask, the shampoo, and conditioner set are great as a whole but separately they do not work well for me. I have long thick hair and the product dried my scalp out when the mask was not applied first. The product, in my opinion doesn't smell the greatest either. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28846,2,Positive,Received this product from Influenster to test in addition to the pre-shampoo mask and shampoo. I used all three products together and it was too drying even though i have an oily scalp. The product smelled great and I loved the color of the product packaging but overall it was very disappointing and lackluster. Not L'Oreal's best. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
28847,2,Positive,"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I really like the concept of this line and I love the clay mask. However, the shampoo and conditioner combo do not help my hair. It made my ends feel very dry and lifeless. They were noticeably worse than when I started using the line. I have color treated hair and maybe that's why it happened. I would be careful if you have bleached ends using this product line. All opinions are my own. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28848,2,Positive,This was my least favorite out of the three extraordinary clay products. It didn't moisturize my dry ends that much and I had to add on a different conditioner afterwords. I received this product complimentary from Influenster. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
28849,2,Positive,"I received this for free in my Influenster vox box. I was so excited to try this along with the clay mask and conditioner. My greasy roots are constantly a source of frustration for me and was hoping this was the answer to my issues. Sadly it was not. I honestly think it made my hair get greasy quicker. Love the concept of the three steps, but simply didn't work for me! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28850,2,Positive,"This was the last step out of the three step process. I will say that this was my least favorite step. The product is designed to take the oil away from your roots and bring moisture to your ends. However, I feel that this brought oil to all of my hair which is why I was left oily later in the day! The smell is great, but I would probably try and use a different conditioner. I received this product free for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28851,2,Positive,"I would like to start off my thanking Influenster and L'Oral for allowing me to try these products at no cost in exchange for an honest review. I also wanted to note that I have blonde, color treated hair. Please keep in mind that just because a product does/does not work for me, does not mean it will/will not work for you. Different products work very different on different hair/skin types. Inside the VoxBox was a clay pre-shampoo treatment, a shampoo, and a conditioner. It claims that there are three different types of clays in this system, all which work together to keep your ends hydrated and your roots non-greasy for a minimum of 48 hours. I was super excited to try this and have been trying it for a little over a month now. I am sadto say that this treatment did not work for me. With my normal hair care regime, my hair will stay non-greasy for about two days. If I used the clay system in the morning, my hair would be greasy by either that night, or the next morning. So my hair actually got greasy faster than usual. My hair would also be very very flat and lifeless as soon as it dried. I really really wanted to love this system as I wish I could go longer than my normal two days without washing my hair, but unfortunately, it did not work for me. One thing I did love about the system is that it smelled amazing and the smell would last all day. I am sure this system could work for some hair types, but not mine.

28852,2,Positive,"I have been a big LOral fan, using their products for more than a decade now. For the past three weeks I have been testing the LOral Paris Hair Expert Extraordinary Clay range - the mask, shampoo and conditioner. I have curly hair with a normal scalp. I have been testing all three products during my regular hair care routine, but also just the shampoo and conditioner without the mask. After applying the mask which felt weird on my scalp (hard to apply, tangled up my hair pretty badly), I used the shampoo. This did not help too much. I lost some hairs during the shampooing process. At the end I applied the conditioner to smooth my hair, but my hair looked messy, tangled, not to mention that my curls vanishes, my hair was dry, undefined and I looked like I had a stack of hay on my head. I tried using just the shampoo and conditioner without the mask, same unfortunate effect. I have noticed that after only 48 hours my hair was oily and I had to wash it right away - something that never happened before to me - so quite the opposite effect that I was expecting for. In conclusion, the whole system - mask, shampoo, conditioner - did not work for my hair. I am sure they will work for other hair types out there, but for mine these were just unfortunate. I received these products complimentary for testing purposes, but all my opinions are honest and coming from a period of three weeks of testing. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28853,2,Positive,"I had the opportunity to test out this product thanks to Influenster and worked like regular drugstore conditioners. Didn't do much for my hair, I ended up having to use my own conditioner to add moisture back into my hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28854,2,Positive,"Despite using this with the line's hair mask and shampoo, I didn't find much difference in oil control the next day and still felt the need to use dry shampoo. It smells nice and made my hair feel soft, but it just didn't live up to all of its promises, in my opinion. Such a shame too because I love the concept and really wanted this to work for me! I received this product free for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
28855,2,Positive,"I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are mine. I have the most oily roots and dry ends ever. No product I have used can cure it. I was feeling optimistic about this product, but it seems like it is the same as other products. Plus there was no smell, which was kind of disappointing. I have only used it once, so I will update my review if my opinion changes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
