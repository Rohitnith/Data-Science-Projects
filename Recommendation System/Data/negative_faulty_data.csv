1151,5,Negative,"I'm kind of sad to see the poor reviews on this product, so I thought I'd write my own. For some reason my hair hates hard water more than most people (we have hard well water, and although the rest of my family noticed their hair was a little less healthy looking, mine looked and felt DISGUSTING because I just could not get the minerals out of my hair, and continuing to wash it only made it worse). This is the only shampoo/conditioner combo that fixed that problem. I had even tried an expensive hard water shampoo that didn't work nearly as well. Even if you don't have hard water issues, this shampoo really made my hair feel lighter and way more voluminous. Everyone's hair is different, but I definitely recommend at least giving this one a try!"

I have major allergies to lotions , laundry soaps , bath soaps , my skin gets so dry it cracks . then I have to use an ointment and bandaids , but once the crack heals to where it is not bleeding I appy this all day and at night , and it has my hands soft by morning ."

1238,5,Negative,"HAVING A 3 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER MEANS I HAVE NO TIME AT ALL, BUT AFTER FINDING FINISH DISHWASHER TABLETS I HAVE REALISED I DON'T KNOW HAVE TO PRE-WASH ALL MY DISHES BEFORE PUTTING THEM IN MY DISHWASHER....WHICH NOW MEANS PUT BABY DOWN TO SLEEP I CAN SIT BACK RELAX AND CONDEMN MY RUBBER GLOVES TO THE BIN!"

1270,5,Negative,"We live in our pool and I can never get my husband or kids to put on sunscreen because they hate the feel of lotions (so do I), and they don't want to interrupt their swimming to dry off and reapply sunscreen. This is great - I carry it around with me and spray everybody, even if they're dripping. You can see this bead up the moisture on the skin, so you know it's not rinsing off. We all tan like crazy, so we don't use this to prevent sunburn, but it seems to stop us from getting too tan and it keeps our skin soft. Be careful not to inhale when you spray this - it's not a good experience."

1393,4,Negative,"I have very, very long hair (about 28 inches worth), and I've always been a little bit of a shampoo snob, but I was in between shampoos and just ran into the drug store to get something and just happened pick this up. I was so impressed by it! After using this shampoo only once, my hair was incredibly smoother and felt stronger! However, there was one really bad thing about this shampoo + conditioner, and it's the conditioner!!! It stinks!! It literally smells like rotten wet dog, it is so atrocious. Luckily the scent doesn't last long after you get out of the shower, but it makes the washing experience feel dirty. The shampoo smells good, but that conditioner...who thought of that scent"
1417,5,Negative,Product works wonders on my curly hair! I'd recommend it to anyone with curly hair.
1420,5,Negative,My hair is naturally curly and very thick and dry. I went to the store to buy something reasonably priced because I was on a budget. I got the sleek and smooth because my hair is outta control. I washed it and waited a little while to dry my hair. It took 10 mins to dry and wasn't dry and frizzy when I was done like it usually is when using other products

1654,4,Negative,I'll play your silly game and take the points for reviewing the movie. Either you liked it or you didn't.
1662,4,Negative,"""I'm not good. I'm not gentle. And I don't forgive."" This is one of my favorite movie quotes ever. Having never seen the television series Dark Shadows, except in a clip here and there, I was a clean slate. It's serious, it's funny, it's hysterical.

1927,4,Negative,This movie is historical.yes it's a silly slapstick comedy. Be prepared to laugh throughout the entire movie.
1938,4,Negative,This is a good funny movie; not ideal for children. Includes a lot of dirty humor.
1957,4,Negative,Funny movie. Not for children or those easily offended by dirty jokes. Typical of the raunchy movies Zac Efron has made lately!

2010,4,Negative,Very funny movie and worth picking up. Won't be disappointed.
2011,4,Negative,"This movie is outrageous, inappropriate, PC incorrect, raunchy stupid slapstick, so over the top that it shouldn't work but, by some miracle mixed with such enthusiastic commitment from everyone involved, this thing fires on all cylinders. It has the same OMG powerhouse energy of classics like THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. Forget credibility and good taste, surrender to its shocking insanity, and you'll treat yourself to one hysterical coronary of a good time."
2015,4,Negative,this movie is great..luv anna kendrick and zac effron...cute romantic comedy
2022,4,Negative,"This is the first movie in a long time that I felt was too short. While a few scenes fall flat, the actors shine."
2023,4,Negative,You could tell just by the cast that this was going to be funny. And it did not disappoint. I would recommend this to someone having a bad day.
2028,4,Negative,The cheesy teen movies have now turned to the cheesy 30 something movies. Not great but worth the watch and could get better the more times you watch it.

2079,4,Negative,This is a amusing adult comedy with a crude undertone.
2086,4,Negative,"This movie was really funny. However, some of the scenes were definitely for mature audiences only. Lots of drug references, crude remarks, and bad language."
2089,4,Negative,If you pick up this movie make sure you are in the mood for stupid fun. The cast is very likeable and the premise very contrived. Not for young or sensitive viewers.

2105,4,Negative,Movie came as expected and with digital copy to boot!
2129,4,Negative,"Seriously one of those stupid, stupid, and stupid but extremely funny movies that you can just sit and laugh at. This is not cinema its just fun."
2133,4,Negative,These two guys accidently find thier equals in creating mayhem and madness.
2168,5,Negative,"AUBREY PLAZA , Anna Kendrick , Zac Efron and Adam Levine take a Hawaiian wedding to new hysterical heights. The girls out do the boys on this one.

3266,4,Negative,"It has been working well without any problem. Also it's very quiet. It has a auto-shut off feature when it reaches to the temperature. Auto-shut off comes with both good and bad. I use it in my office when it gets too cold. Since it automatically shuts-off, I'm afraid I might forget to turn it off when I leave my work. Besides it, it has been working well."
3275,5,Negative,I love my new personal heater. It works well at work when the air conditioner gets too cold!
3280,5,Negative,It heats a big room in my home with no problem. I have 2 of them
3282,5,Negative,Est muy bueno y excelente para una oficina.

3363,4,Negative,On my first try with both the shampoo and conditioner I notice that my hair is less dull so my natural curls are falling softer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
3379,4,Negative,I have been using the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner for a couple of week on my short white hair. Never been able to use other conditioner because it's too heavy for my hair and usually end up with flat hair NOT WITH THIS ONE. I like the way my hair feels with Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
3396,5,Negative,I have an issue with my hair being weak and breakage is an issue. The actual conditioner feels like a deeper moisture mask and smells like honey and oatmeal to the point that it made me hungry for breakfast. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
3401,5,Negative,"I had been using another brand of Conditioner for aging hair, but the Pantene works just as well , if not better than the one I have been using for the past year. I would recommend it as well as the shampoo. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

3702,5,Negative,firm hold without dandruff
3711,4,Negative,There's never enough of the soda on the shelf it seems that when I go to purchase it there always are down to one or two cases. It doesn't have a bad aftertaste considering that it's diet.
3713,5,Negative,I have drunk it plenty times and l would say its fab..
3718,5,Negative,Mary Desilets Canada Dry is the ONLY Ginger Ale! Growing up as a kid I remember when I was sick with a cold and sore throat A Canada Dry Ginger Ale with some vanilla ice cream Always made me feel better...STILL DOES! I had 2 vanilla ginger ale sodas today. Right now sitting here with a small glass of Canada Dry Ginger Ale! mmm mmm good!
3722,5,Negative,I have been drinking Canada Dry because it has Real Gingerin it. It is such a soothing drink when I need something to perk me up..the little fizzes makes me think of sizzles when meat is cooking...
3732,5,Negative,This is my son's drink of choice! The only problem we have here in Villa Rica GA is finding the diet ginger ale. Our retailers just don't stock enough of the diet ginger ale!!
3740,5,Negative,Does not have a bad taste like other diet drinks do.
3745,5,Negative,I love this product but I have a hard time finding it in some of your stores so I go to Publix because they have a variety of flavors of this product!!!
3750,5,Negative,"I started growing out my hair a couple months ago. BoC Clay Pomade used to be my go-to product, but it was making my hair a bit too stiff as it got longer. I tried this cream as a substitute, and it's just what I needed."

3858,4,Negative,use for billing Keeping reciepts in order and invoices in order
3872,4,Negative,As soon as I saw it I knew it would help with my upcoming trip to Montreal. I'm always looking for ways to organize and this will defintely help. I've already told others about the product.
3876,4,Negative,"I really like this folder. The one thing I would change is the stock currently, it's too thin."
3877,4,Negative,"Recipes...low fat, low calorie, low carb.. Travel... agenda...hotels...flights Workshop...information...notes....books to read Things to do....urgent...in a week Trip....receipts...information...brochures Project....receipts.....information....brochures Stocks to buy....information... different recommendations... different"
3903,4,Negative,I use this product for both personal and business use.

3945,4,Negative,"I am a teacher, and I use a folder to organize all the paperwork I need for the day. I can separate papers needed for each class, and those needed for meetings."
3950,4,Negative,Using Divide-It-Up allows you to see what is actually in the file by just opening the folder and looking at it. You don't have to shuffle through all the papers in the folder to find what you're looking for. I just started using these folders and I believe Divide-It-Up will help everyone our the office.
3951,4,Negative,practical and can contained sorted documents in one folder
3952,4,Negative,Using to organize Mothers bills/insurance/car/house/etc.

4036,5,Negative,"Use Folders for Customers in order to separate invoices, payment info, etc."
4039,5,Negative,I like that I could place things of different heights in the pockets and also see them when I opened the folder. It will help not to have to go thru looking for smaller things and it also keeps them from falling out.
4040,5,Negative,"I USE FOR MEDICAL RECORDS AND INFO, ONE FOR EACH CONTINUING PROBLEM: HEART, EYES, MOBILITY ETC."
4042,5,Negative,"As a person with Asperger's Syndrome, putting paper in one manilla folder would get lost. These folders have built in internal dividers to help me sort and organize a single file folder. The colors help as well because I am over 5 programs, which these folders come in three, but I can have one color for one program. I would recommend adding a couple of colors to the pack."
4044,5,Negative,"only issue is the placement of the tab, should be away from the bottom fold (in portrait orientation)"
4065,5,Negative,"The folders were exactly what I needed to organize our tax papers to take to the accountant, replacing the bulky folder that I had used in the past. I bought two packs so that I can completely reorganize other records as well."
4068,5,Negative,"I use this to seperate the billing for my department. Needs to be paid, paid, and invoices that have not yet appeard on credit card statement"
4070,5,Negative,Will help me to stay organised with different counseling topics.
4076,5,Negative,"I used the DIU Colored folders to sort and store my tax documents and records by related categories. For example, one folder was labeled Medical Expenses wth the pockets sub labeled, Medications, Doctors, and Lab Tests. This kept medical records together but sorted by type."
4079,5,Negative,"I have wanted this product since seeing it online a few months back. I'm a little disappointed that larger packs aren't available. I had to buy two packs which was a bit expensive. I would love to see more colors too. I use these for my credit card statements, insurance and all other personal home business documents. I like the brilliance and simplicity of the dividers. I would like them to be a little sturdier going forward."
4093,5,Negative,I can access different parts of the client presentation easily. Small pieces don't get lost in the shuffle.
4098,5,Negative,"The folder assists with the organization of the documents within the folder, making it easier to finds papers needed."
4123,5,Negative,This is what I use to wash my granddaughter's clothing and it's gentler than the usual baby detergents. I now use it for the entire family
4128,5,Negative,I used these boxes as hardware organizers and they are very tough. I have one that I have had for 8 or 9 years now. Can never have enough.
4191,4,Negative,"The Bad such as it is, is that the Porta Power canister vac hasn't had much visible evolution over the years, other than to get rid of the gaskets inside the end of the wand. (Actually, that's a big plus! - I used to have a commercial Porta Power and that gasket gave me fits.) Now for the Good. No more getting dust in the face when emptying the vacuum cleaner. I used to have a Dyson Animal, and while not needing bags was nice, it was all but impossible to not get a cloud of dust when emptying it. Two other big pluses over the Dyson are that the Platinum's head is thinner, so I can get further under funiture, and by switching to low suction, I can do area rugs that were completely impossible with the Dyson."
4197,4,Negative,I would have given it a 5-star except I wish it had manual height adjustment. We have a thick sheer-cut carpet and it makes a 5-line marking pattern when vacuuming.
4218,4,Negative,"In spite of having lots of suction, unit is poor at ""edge"" cleaning. This replaces a very heavy upright, so the lighter weight is a big plus. There is no height adjustment for carpeting, so is difficult to use on shag. On shag one must raise the unit to move forward and pull back across carpet.Pushing unit forward on shag Very difficult. The canister works very well.Lots of power."
4222,4,Negative,"Bought the vacuum because of weight of our previous one...was very difficult for my wife to carry it upstairs. This one is very light and the suction is tremendous. However, our bedroom carpet is deep and plush. The self adjusting feature doesn't adjust enough for this type carpet. The machine is very hard to push on the carpet, and the brush and wheels leave deep tracks. We have to rake the carpet after vacuuming. I recommend the vacuum if your carpet is not the deep and plush variety."
4224,4,Negative,Haven't gotten a chance to use. Hope to use this weekend.
4237,4,Negative,"The Bad such as it is, is that the Porta Power canister vac hasn't had much visible evolution over the years, other than to get rid of the gaskets inside the end of the wand. (Actually, that's a big plus! - I used to have a commercial Porta Power and that gasket gave me fits.) Now for the Good. No more getting dust in the face when emptying the vacuum cleaner.

Two other big pluses over the Dyson are that the Platinum's head is thinner, so I can get further under funiture, and by switching to low suction, I can do area rugs that were completely impossible with the Dyson."
4241,4,Negative,"I bought this vacuum because it is lightweight and bagged. I love it. Totally. But the included cannister has serious issues: the floor brush won't stay on the wand without duct tape(!) the upholstry brush is useless--very small and the dusting brush is non-existent (some strange thing you fit onto the upholstry brush). What was Hoover thinking I still have to use my old cannister vacuum to handle upholstry, stairs and furniture dusting. What a disappointment."
4275,5,Negative,"We have hardwood floor, carpet, carpeted stairs and tile and wanted a lightweight vacuum cleaner that could be used everywhere. This Hoover does it all and with minimal effort!"
4286,5,Negative,I bought the bagged upright with canister in 12/ 07/13. Love it. Will never go back to a bagless vacuum. They are disgusting to clean and all the junk you breathe when dumping it
4334,5,Negative,"I'm a guy, what can I say.... it works!"
4337,5,Negative,Buy it-great value
4340,5,Negative,"Love the sweeper, compared it to a Oreck. Only problem I have is you can't find bags for it at Walmart.. Inconvenient trying to locate sweeper bags for this model. Hoover site cost me a fortune for 4 bags. Shipping was high 8.50 and the bags are very expensive. So purchasing 4 Sweeper bags plus 4 sweeper bags for the hand model was like 34.00.. Just for bags!!! I do wish I would have went with the ORECK!"
4369,5,Negative,"Overall, this is a terrific vacuum. The person who will be happiest with this combination is the person who: (1) wants a lightweight vacuum, (2) has mostly carpet in their home, (3) has carpeted stairs, and (4) uses attachments."
4383,5,Negative,I've had this for about a week and have had no problems.
4398,5,Negative,"We did quite a bit of research on HEPA vacuums before settling on this model. So far we LOVE this vacuum. You can easily spend $500 for a Oreck Vacuum that has these same features - but save your money, this Hoover is all you need.My son has a terrible dust mite allergy, we notice a difference already in his breathing due to b- weekly cleaning with our Hoover."
4402,5,Negative,"Believe it or not, way less messy to empty and clean than those bagless vaccum cleaners. I had one before this that I practically needed a mask to empty... And if I tried to do indoors, I would have to vaccum again... This problem does not happen with this product."
4436,5,Negative,"For those of you who need a review to consider buying this, here it is:I have been using this vacuum for about a month now and absolutely love it. The suction is great.....no complaints there. Sorry I waited so long to buy it. I used to have a Dyson, but it was so heavy, and I always had to dump the canister which would cause the dust to go back into the air, and it would not reach under things due to its size. I use this vac almost everyday due to 3 cats and 1 dog, and am just amazed by how well it picks up all the hair. Sure, you have to buy bags, but at least you won't get all the dust flying around as you would with the bagless vacs.I got the canister vac with this, but really don't use it unless doing under cushions. I have had no problems with this vacuum picking up all the dirt, etc. along the bottom of the baseboads.....it gets it all."
4455,5,Negative,"I read all the reviews and was hesitant to purchase such an expensive vacuum cleaner but one of the things I needed was something that was good at picking up dog hair on both carpeted and hardwood floors. I decided to try this since it got no bad reviews and WOW! I have never ever had a vacuum cleaner that had such suction and power. I was so amazed at how easily it moved due to the ""self-propelled"" mechanism.The only improvement would be to have some attachments on board so when you are vacuuming a room you could quickly do corners, etc., but then it probably would take away from the suction power! The little vacuum is very convenient for little jobs and it will work for when I need the attachments.One thing that I never saw in any of the reviews I read is that the vacuum cleaner bags are self-sealing. That means that when you remove them from the vacuum cleaner, they automatically seal so no dust or particles escape into the air. I always hated that when I had to re-vacuum after removing a bag. The bags are very thick and high quality so it's no wonder they are expensive.If you are debating about this one and you're on the edge, just take the plunge. You won't be disappointed!"
4476,5,Negative,"We have hardwood floor, carpet, carpeted stairs and tile and wanted a lightweight vacuum cleaner that could be used everywhere. This Hoover does it all and with minimal effort!"
4507,5,Negative,This fragrance will turn heads. I get a lot of compliments.
4523,5,Negative,"Lowest price, timely delivery."
4564,4,Negative,I was glad to see this box set that included all 6 Resident Evil movies. Been wanting all of them for some time but didn't want to pay for them separately
4573,4,Negative,Purchased the movie to round out my collection of the franchise. It did not disappoint.
4575,4,Negative,This is a great purchase for any resident evil fan. To get all of the movies at the bargain price that I did is simply a steal!
4581,4,Negative,Doesn't necessarily follow the same story as the video games. But it's decent for the fans. Plus the price isn't bad.
4583,4,Negative,Convenient package of all the movies if you didn't get them as they came out
4584,4,Negative,"After the second one, I really couldn't stand the movies, but my wife loves them. Even with that, it's a great set, and a good price. Includes:Resident Evil - A guilty pleasure that mixes a few points from the video game with an overall good zombie flick.Resident Evil: Apocalypse - A definite attempt to merge the first movie with more elements from the game.Resident Evil: Extinction - Um... who put zombies in Mad Max?Resident Evil: Afterlife - This movie was primarily made to undo the third one and overuse every 3D gag in existence.Resident Evil: Retribution - Like the fourth one, but want more... everything? Then this movie is for you."
4614,4,Negative,These movies are always ones that I am willing to watch from the past
4616,4,Negative,Get the best of the resident evil movies in one set
4622,4,Negative,if your looking to just buy all the movies at once then this is for you
4626,4,Negative,Ienjoyed this collection of cd's and would recommend to others .
4634,4,Negative,"I've been a fan of resident evil since it came out back in the day, I only have the first movie on DVD so what is on the 5 movies in a box set I had to pick it up!"
4637,4,Negative,Great value. A must for any Resident Evil movie or game fan.
4645,4,Negative,This collection boxset has all the Resident Evil films except the final chapter. Each film is really action pack and good special effects. I plan to get the Resident Evil: Final Chapter bluray to complete my collection.
4648,4,Negative,5 films for the price of $14.99 on Blu-ray. It is a steal.
4653,4,Negative,"I like these movies, found them on sale, in blue ray, with digital copies, had to have it."
4659,4,Negative,"I didn't really like these movies like I had hoped. They are extremely cheeses but if you have nothing better to do I guess it's not the worst. However to review the quilt of the set, I must say that $15 for 5 blurays isn't bad. Nothing special about them but it is a nice bundled discount."
4665,4,Negative,I don't know about everyone else but I always thought these Resident Evil movies were a hundred times better than the video games. The video games were so cheesy and the voice acting was terrible.
4671,4,Negative,"All the RE movies in one bundle, nothing else to say."
4677,4,Negative,"I am not a huge fan of the horror genre or Resident Evil, but experiencing these movies is worth the (low) cost of entry."
4679,4,Negative,Having all the resident evil movies at one low price. Quality is great and the individual movies each have their bonus scenes
4681,4,Negative,Resident evil was a good game and the movies was even better.
4683,4,Negative,This is a great buy if you're a fan of the Resident Evil franchise. You can't beat the price.
4684,4,Negative,If you want to get into this series and have the patience for their being what they are (mindless action packed thrill rides) then this is for you.
4686,4,Negative,I'm a big fan of the Resident Evil series. Found this box set on sale for $20 bucks!
4687,4,Negative,"Bought the set for my gf since she is a fan of the resident evil series and for the price that we paid for, it was a great steal."
4693,4,Negative,Each movie adds a different twist. Too bad it didn't include the final movie.
4706,4,Negative,Really nice collection. Only bad part is that does. It come with digital copies or ultraviolet as stated.
4710,4,Negative,"My husband loves this series and when we seen the price, we knew we had to get it."
4713,4,Negative,I like the box set for it have all the movies in it and the digital nd with ultraviolet.
4714,4,Negative,"Not a fan of all the films in the set, but the price can't be beat. You get all 5 films for less then the price of just one film."
4728,4,Negative,"If you're an avid movie collector, a fan of the Resident Evil movie series, and somehow haven't purchased these movies, you can't go wrong with this 5 movie for $15 deal!"
4729,4,Negative,I would recommend this collection it play clears and amazing sound. If you are a resident evil fan get it
4736,4,Negative,I brought this as a gift for a friend's birthday..
4746,4,Negative,"It took a while, but I got through all of them. Then I bought the sixth installment which was crazy good. But I wonder when will Hollywood go back to using tripods? I'm getting nauseous watching all the shaky cam."
4747,4,Negative,I finally saw these in correct order and it all makes sense now!!!
4755,4,Negative,If you like the live action resident evil films then at $15 for the first 5 on bluray it's quite a deal.
4756,4,Negative,"As a fan of the zombie genre, I am a firm believer that Resident Evil helped kick start the latest movement. These movies are a great horror/action ride. The movies don't follow the game play, so don't go looking for hidden clues."
4757,5,Negative,Grest value on blue ray to get all 5 movies for this price!
4758,5,Negative,"Adapted from the video game, this film series is an instant sic-fi cheese guilty pleasure for any fan of Resident Evil. Enough said. :)"
4764,5,Negative,If you like this sort of entertainment you won't be disappointed with this purchase. Tons of action and excitement.

4863,5,Negative,Best movies of resident evil totally based on the video games.
4868,5,Negative,What's not to like about a box set with all the Resident Evil films? Alice (Milla Jovovich) takes on the evil Umbrella Corporation. A well done migration from video game screens to the big screen.
4869,5,Negative,I like having all the movies in the same binder. Once in a while I will the movies one a night for 5 consecutive nights.
4875,5,Negative,I like resident evil movies the 5 in one is good ye
4879,5,Negative,This is a must have collection for any movie lover.
4880,5,Negative,The five disc collection takes the viewer through all of the Resident Evil movies released so far. Yet after purchasing I have seen notices for a sixth installment. If you enjoy the plot you'll enjoy these.

4908,5,Negative,"Didn't know there was a Blu-Ray box set and When I saw it, I had to have it!"
4913,5,Negative,I came late to the RE franchise so I had seen parts and pieces of all 5 but not in any order and certainly not sequentially. Finally I get to see the sequence as it was meant to be - in order. Not much to say about the physical discs themselves - they work. But I've really enjoyed the collection.
4922,5,Negative,If u like the resident evil series and want to see the final one next year then u need this box set it will get u ready for the final chapater next year

5035,5,Negative,My fianc? introduced me to the Resident Evil franchise and I was not disappointed. I love that it takes up so much less space than the DVD set. We're slowly replacing all our DVD's and the picture quality is worth it.

It was a sad day when I watched the last movie in theaters."

15692,5,Negative,"I was unable to find this product in any store, so I took to walmart.com. Luckily I was able to order it. We unfortunately have a critter that died in our heater vent. The smell was unbearable. An exterminator recommended that we find this product and mist it into our furnace filter, not to saturate it, just mist it a few times while the heat blew on as high as the heat could go. We had already tried everything we could think of and nothing was working. Within 10 min it began to remove the Thick Horrific Smell that was lingering in our home. You have no idea how grateful our family is."
15697,5,Negative,"I buy this by the case and don't use any other multipurpose cleaners. When my sister and her family caught a horrible stomach virus, I gave my brother-in-law a bottle.

15834,4,Negative,So disappointed that Cocoa is discontinued. Haven't found a lip shimmer color I like to replace it. All are too red or pink. Hope you will consider bringing it back.
15838,4,Negative,"Raisin formula changed so the color is lighter and brighter which I don't care for. Prefer the darker, richer previous Raisin color. But I like the tingle/massage from the peppermint."
15840,4,Negative,"I used my last Toffee color lip shimmer awhile back...can't find it anymore. Guess they did away with it also, like they did Cocoa I used Toffee and Champagne all the time."
15841,4,Negative,Oh please bring back nutmeg! I have been looking forever. Is there any color you offer at this time that is close or possibly the same color with a different name : (
15846,4,Negative,"I am so disappointed that the Cocoa Lip Shimmer has been discontinued. I haven't been able to find any small, keep-it-in-your-pocket lip color that I like. Please bring Cocoa back! You're losing me, Burt :("
15856,4,Negative,"I join others to say please bring cocoa back. I am so surprised and disappointed that you don't offer it anymore. It's a great color...very classy, not bright and garish like some. Please return cocoa...it is the only color I like."
15862,4,Negative,"When wanting to add some color without all the chemicals I reach for this but! before I reach for this I reach for a balm to add moisture, because if my lips are not pre-moisturized they get dry after an hour or so of wearing lip shimmer"
15868,4,Negative,"i love the color, i bought fig and plum, they both look great on me. those colors have a subtle shimmer. the only problem is that the peppermint oil has a sort of weird feeling, but it's not too bad. u should check for allergies to peppermint oil before buying this"
15890,4,Negative,You sooo need to bring Coca back!!! I don't like wearing lipstick especially in the summer. Burt's Bees gave me an option of keeping my lips soft with color but they too Coca AWAY!! All of the 4 other different colors I have tired just look awful on me and it hasn't matter which season we are in. PLEASE PLEASE IT BACK!!!!
15901,4,Negative,The only color I've worn for years is Cocoa--I didn't realize you discontinued it or I would have stock-piled it a long time ago! Now I'm down to a tiny bit left. I went on line today to order some since I haven't seen it in the stores--only to find out it doesn't exist anymore. I'm so sad. The other colors are too pink or too orange for me. Please consider bringing it back--I for sure will buy some!!
15935,5,Negative,Thank you for bringing back Cocoa!! I've missed it!!!!
15942,5,Negative,Cocoa is the only one that I like. Now I'll have to change products. Very sad.
15950,5,Negative,Please please please bring back cocoa... it is the only color I can wear!
15954,5,Negative,I use this product all the time. I have replaced my lip stick with this.
15955,5,Negative,Cocoa is the only shade that works on me! Please bring it back!
15956,5,Negative,Thank you times a million for bringing back cocoa lip shimmer!
15959,5,Negative,I love this color and I can't find it anymore! Please bring it back! Not Happy!:(
15961,5,Negative,Color and moisture are long lasting. Doesn't dry out my lips like regular lipstick does.
15967,5,Negative,please bring back papaya!!! You don't offer anything even close to that color... This review was collected as part of a promotion.
15975,5,Negative,I miss two of my favorites - Nutmet and Papaya. Where can I find them or something close.
15977,5,Negative,I have 3 different colors. i like the shimmer along with the slight tint. They wear well also.
15978,5,Negative,To bad my business will be driven somewhere else. Not happy to lose a product I loved so much!
15979,5,Negative,"Lip shimmer not only makes your lips look shiney and luscious, it gives them a little tingle!"
15985,5,Negative,Would appreciate it if you brought back the cocoa shade. Am dissatisfied that it was discontinued.
15986,5,Negative,Please bring nutmeg back!!!!! This is the only color for I've skin and black hair that is natural.
15988,5,Negative,I agree with others - please bring back Cocoa Lip Shimmer. None of the current colors come close.
15992,5,Negative,i had one color but was looking for something lighter for the spring/summer look and i found it.
15994,5,Negative,I really like the fact that it just gives your lips a little sparkle with not much color. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
15996,5,Negative,I use this product instead of lipstick so I don't have to worry about what chemicals I am inadvertently swallowing.
16005,5,Negative,The color (merlot) fits well with my lip. Moisture of shimmer is not good enough but I like the color.
16017,5,Negative,"I've been using Lip Shimmer in Cocoa as long as I can remember! My only comment is PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE bring Cocoa back!"
16018,5,Negative,I've been using the Papaya lip shimmer for years and now it's gone.......... Haven't found another color that I like. Darn!
16022,5,Negative,I've been desperately looking for cocoa at every retailer for months! So sad to come here find it's been discontinued!
16046,5,Negative,Thank you for bringing this back. It is the absolute best every day color! I've been missing it terribly ... nothing else comes close to it.
16070,5,Negative,"This product covers all my needs-color, conditioning casual. I can use it at work (hospital) and not feel like it is too much."
16077,5,Negative,I've been using NUTMEG for years. Please bring it back! Its the only color that doesn't turn pink on my skin and can be worn day or night.
16084,5,Negative,"Hello! I miss lip shimmer in merlot color. Please bring it back. I've tried plum and raisin, but nothing measures up to Merlot. Merci!"
16095,5,Negative,I want to add my request to the others to bring back Cocoa lip shimmer and let us know when that happens. It's the only shade I have used for years.
16106,5,Negative,"No other color will do. So disappointed to see it discontinued. Please, please, please bring back Nutmeg Lip Shimmer and I will continue to buy in bulk :)"
16127,5,Negative,I need to know when you will bring back Nutmeg Lip Shimmer. My face was burned in an accident and Nutmeg is the only color whose pigment combination does not make my lips crack.
16154,5,Negative,"Please bring back cocoa! It's the only thing I've worn on my lips for years. I've tried other colors, but they just don't work with my coloring. Please, please, please!"
16163,5,Negative,"I finally found a lip product with everything I've ever wanted! Color, moisture, natural ingredients, and long lasting. I doubt I will ever buy any lipstick or gloss or any other balm ever again."
16184,5,Negative,"Please,please,please listen to your customers.... Remember your customers are the ones that keep your business going..We all miss the shade Cocoa..Read all the reviews asking you to bring it back....Listen to us,please...."
16205,5,Negative,I'm so sad that this color has been discontinued. When I found out it was going to be I bought about 10 I've gone through them all now and I'm finding it difficult to find a replacement. Pls Pls bring it back.!!
16208,5,Negative,"Please bring back Cocoa lip shimmer. It is the only color that works for me. I have been to several places hoping to find a lingering one, all to find that they are all gone! Please, please bring it back!"
16212,5,Negative,"I have used the color Cocoa for years. It is the ONLY lip color I wear. Please, please, please bring it back. I bought the Plum, it's not the same. I am SO sad! Listen to your fans. Bring back the cocoa!"
16247,5,Negative,"I am so sad that Cocoa has been discontinued! It is the only color I like and will sadly have to start using another brand. I see that there are lots of woman like me who love the cocoa! Please, please reconsider cocoa!"
16249,5,Negative,I see I am not the only person that would like to see the Cocoa color brought back. I was searching every store I would go in - no wonder I couldn't find it! Just wondering why they discontinued it Please bring it back!!!
16250,5,Negative,"Please please PLEASE bring back nutmeg. I have used that color for years, and I am so upset that I cannot find it anymore. Nutmeg looks natural with my olive complexion, unlike some other shades. Please!! Bring nutmeg back."
16255,5,Negative,"Please bring this color back!!! I have searched high and low for a color that works for me and my lifestyle, and this is the one. Colors are getting too pinky which is not necessarily suitable for some ages and skin color types."
16262,5,Negative,"I have gone to about 20 different stores looking for Cocoa.... then I thought to go on-line and order, only to find out you no longer sell this color. Please, Please, Please bring back the color Cocoa in the Lip Shimmer. Thank you"
16265,5,Negative,"I LOVE Burts Bees Lip Shimmer...but I'm with the others here...PLEASE bring COCOA back to us!!! If I had known that it was being discontinued, I would have bought several tubes before it disappeared!!! Now, I can't find even ONE tube ANYWHERE!! :("
16278,5,Negative,"I use Raisin nearly every day. It never looks fake or overpowering, and it seems to last a long time. I hardly ever wear regular lipstick anymore, this is just such a lovely improvement. Will definitely have to try other shades when this one runs out."
16303,5,Negative,"It's been over a year now, and I'm still desperately missing your cocoa lip shimmer. I've tried at least a dozen substitutes, and nothing comes close. Maybe you could consider the limited release of discontinued colors on an annual basis. The demand is certainly there."
16307,5,Negative,"This is all I use on my lips. My lips are so moist from this product. I have one at work, one in my purse, and one at home. I don't ever want to be without this lipwear. I ride a motorcycle and this stay on a long time so my lips never get chapped from the wind."
16308,5,Negative,Your current pink pallet does not suit me. My daughter and I are crazy for cocoa. Obsessed with this lip color. I look in every town I visit hoping to find some out-of-the-way stash. When will we see Cocoa Lip Shimmer back on the shelf
16310,5,Negative,I am begging with everyone else.....PLEASE bring back COCOA!!! I LOVE this shade and have been going crazy trying to find one last one....Why oh Why would you discontinue it!! I have tried other colors and they are just not the same!!
16327,5,Negative,"I've been looking in all the stores for Nutmeg Lip Simmer unsuccessfully, and so I came to your site today. I'm so sad to see you don't carry it anymore. PLEASE start carrying it again! I join with the others that love it and can't find a replacement for it!"
16328,5,Negative,I want to 2nd everyone's reviews on the cocoa lip shimmer. PLEASE PLEASE bring it back. I too went all over town buying every one I could find when I heard it was discontinued. Please help a sister out and make it again. I've been wearing it for years!!! Nothing else will do!!!!!
16338,5,Negative,I am upset at myself for discovering the greatness of this product just now. It lasts longer than other Burt's Bees lip balms. I also like how the color of the lip shimmer is subtle on my lips because I hate color exaggeration. I am definitely going to purchase this again.
16343,5,Negative,"I LOVE the cocoa lip shimmer and search for it at every store I visit that carry's the Burt's Bee line of products. After visiting this site and learning that it has been discontinued (through another review) I am sad. Please consider bringing it back, even if only as a Web site exclusive."
16353,5,Negative,"I've been using both the cocoa toffee shades for years. It is the only thing I ever put on my lips! But when I went to restock this week, I searched 7 different stores that carry BB products, and cannot find the two shades I use. Are they being discontinued that is so disappointing!"
16379,5,Negative,"I was always told to wear lipstick, but I hated the feel of lipstick, and the stickiness of lip gloss so this was a god sent! I reccomend it to everyone and anyone!it makes my lips so soft and supple and gives the perfect look of natural and subtle color and shine. my favorites are watermelon and peony."
16403,5,Negative,"You all missed the boat on this one. Why doesn't whomever made the poor decision to discontinue Cocoa and Toffee ante up to their error and bring it back! You have endless reviews asking same. In my close circle of ten friends, five used Cocoa! Seriously ... please bring it back. Your new colors are NO match."
16404,5,Negative,I was on a cruise and some how ended up with sunburnt lips. A friend I was traveling with gave me her Burt's Bee lip shimmer. I used it and boy what a life saver it was. It not only kept my lips moist but covered up the ugly spots from the sun damage. Since the cruise I have purchased this product multiple times. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
16427,5,Negative,"Love the product HATE that Cocoa is GONE! I have read many of the comments and it is obvious that a mistake was made in discontinuing Cocoa!! I sit here with four colors Plum, Fig, Peony, Watermelon and not one of them or even a combination of them even come close to Cocoa. None of them even look nice on me very disappointing. Please bring back Cocoa and SOON."
16428,5,Negative,"Have been using the cocoa lip shimmer for a few years now and have been searching for it the last month, came on-line to order it and am VERY sad and disappointed to find out it is no longer available. I am with some of the others and am begging you to PLEASE bring it back!! No other colors come close. That has become the only lipstick I use other than glosses."
16454,5,Negative,"My 5 star rating is for the color Cocoa, but it is no longer offered. I am disappointed to learn that you Cocoa lip Shimmer is discontinued. I have been wearing it for years and the other colors do not compare. Please consider bringing it back. Without this color my rating would be a 1 because the colors are just not worth buying. Love the product but not the current colors available."
16460,5,Negative,I'm very disappointed that they have discontinued the lip shimmer in 'Toffee'...i've tried other colors along with the 'Cocoa'..and these two are my favorite...i've been using these lip shimmers for a very long time and the Toffee is still my favorite I still keep looking in the stores hoping that Burt's Bees will bring this color back....please please please.....love them.....
16481,5,Negative,"PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA!! I have searched every drug store and grocery store in a 30 mile radius and cannot find any remaining Cocoa lip shimmers. I have a horrible time finding a lip color that works for me, and Cocoa is perfect I have worn it for years. I receive compliments every time I wear it. I have searched my local makeup chain store and dept stores for a color similar to no avail. PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA!!"
16519,5,Negative,"I have been using the champagne lip shimmer for a couple years now. I absolutely buy nothing else. I keep one in my car, in my purse, in my desk drawer, and always have one in my pocket. It moisturizes, lasts and works. Only bad thing I can say is it is never in stock at the stores. I have started to buy online and it works fabulously."
16542,5,Negative,"I have used the lip shimmer Cocoa for several years now, after it was recommended to me by a co-worker. After I discovered Cocoa, I discarded Nutmeg and Watermelon and a couple others, and have never searched further. Now I find that Cocoa is unavailable! I looked through the new color line-up and do not see even a close substitute. Please bring back Cocoa. If not I will look for a new product line. I find it stupid and frustrating that Burt's Bees would mess with its products and customers, for reasons I cannot discern."
16548,5,Negative,"I love my Burt's Bees Lip Shimmers. I can't wear any other lipsticks because they taste awful. BUT, I miss TOFFEE! I wear Cocoa and Toffee. I've tried some of the other shades, but they don't work for my skin tone. If I added Toffee to those other colors though, they worked. Now I'm left scraping the remnants of the tubes with lip brushes to get the last bit of Toffee out of the tubes. Once I'm completely out, those other colors will be thrown out. They just don't look good on me. : ( Please bring back Toffee!"
16550,5,Negative,"I have been buying Cocoa Lip Shimmer for years, it is the only brown lipstick/ lipbalm that holds it color, doesn't bleed, and doesn't rub off on my teeth - there has been no other color like it - I had no idea it had been discontinued!! Please bring it back. I usually buy it 2 or 3 tubes at a time, and keep one in my purse and in various places around the house. I only have a partial tube left, and cannot find any other color like it in the Burt's Bees lines or in other brands. Why was it discontinued"
16559,5,Negative,"I am currently in a state of panic! I need cocoa lip shimmer. It is the one thing I have to have with me at all times. I just lost one tube and my second tube just ran out. Cocoa lip shimmer is the only health beauty product that I cannot live without! I am completely devastated, to say the least! I searched all the usual spots where I buy it, and it is nowhere to be found. I had to settle for the caramel one, but I am still not happy. Cocoa is the only thing I have been putting on my lips for YEARS! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE BRING BACK COCOA!"
16563,5,Negative,"Why, oh why, did you discontinue COCOA Lip Shimmer None of the other colors work for me......too pink, too red,too purple,too light,or too dark. COCOA matched my natural lip color, and complemented my complexion. I had not worn make-up lipstick in years. I kept it in my make-up tray and in my purse. Now, I have to look for another brand of something, and I hate it.....buy, try, discard, and then start all over, again. I am so disappointed, PLEASE, PLEASE, reconsider this decision!!! AND BRING IT BACK! Linda, a faithful user of COCOA."
16568,5,Negative,"I have been using Lip Shimmers for a few years now. My favorite color is Rhubarb-because it adds just the right amount of color-not too much, not too little. I also like this product because for me-it has an extra added health benefit. I have a tendency to get cold sores-and since using Lip Shimmers(which have all sorts of wonderful herbal ingredients) cold sores have rarely made an appearrance. It also doesn't taste or smell to bad like some lipsticks. The only thing i don't like about it-is that it doesn't last long enough!!"
16571,5,Negative,I have a few tubes of the Lip Shimmer. I like the fact that when I put it on it stays on and I also like the fact that it's natural adds just a little bit of color and it continues to moisturizes your lips.
16580,5,Negative,"It has just the right amount of color and beautiful shimmer for a glow rather than glitter mess. I was a bit apprehensive due to some horrific views, but newbies should ignore them and go and get some! I read stories of them drying out the lips or too much shimmer. Yes, there is noticeable shimmer but it only adds another dimension to the lippie. I got the lip trio of peony, fig, and champagne. Peony is like a pink bronzy or frosted color while fig is a no shimmer berry color. Champagne is a baby pink frost color but the shimmer is not overwhelming, believe me (I am African American and these colors still look flattering on me). So, if you are still a bit hesitant about the shimmer, try fig or plum which have no shimmer. By the way, the minty feel and smell is a bonus since it will freshen your breath while adding a smoothing feel to the lips."
16603,5,Negative,"I came to the website to email Burt's Bees about Cocoa...to ask whether there was any chance it might be brought back and also to find out what shade might be close. I've wasted money on two other colors, trying to find something else I like, with no success. I thought I must have been part of a small minority of people who really loved this shade. But now after seeing all the reviews, I see that I AM NOT ALONE!!! When it was discontinued, I purchased a few tubes from somebody on eBay. Now the eBay sharks are charging CRAZY amounts of for it - not that I can blame them. It's the law of supply of demand. Why doesn't Burt's Bees want our business Clearly there were A LOT of us buying this shade. Please, please hear our pleas and bring back Cocoa."
16611,5,Negative,Very very very unhappy that you do not have lip shimmer in cocoa anymore. How disappointing to not be able to find this color. I have used this color for a very long time and can't believe you got rid of it. All the new colors do not match my skin tone and I do not like any of them. The color cocoa was perfect for me. Please please bring it back and I will buy 10 at a time just so I will have that color. Companies do this all the time and I don't understand why they do this when the product is selling well. I am one very unhappy Burt's Bees customer.This is the only product I bought from your line so I guess I am done with your lip shimmer. So very sad! Debbie
16614,5,Negative,"I have used about every wax on the market, and remembered my mom used this wax on her floor when i was a kid. It made an ever lasting impression then, and it still does"
16622,5,Negative,its cleaner of course it works
16686,4,Negative,"Not what I expected, I had to strain the stuff that I juice."
16731,5,Negative,This product works as advertised. I use it every day.
16738,5,Negative,I bought this for my mother for Mother's Day and she makes juices every morning! She loves it!
16752,5,Negative,I was looking to buy Juice Extractor and this one fits the bill.
16797,4,Negative,Different rice.
16805,4,Negative,"The rice is ok, it turns out very sticky, not sure if it's because I cook it wrong or too long. But, we are not a fan of it!"
16861,5,Negative,Yum ... YUM!
16868,5,Negative,This rice is tasty - has sort of a nutty flavor and is supposed to be very low on the glycemic scale.
16871,5,Negative,This is our go to rice. It comes put slightly sticky which is what we like with our meals.
16885,5,Negative,yummy as always
16894,5,Negative,met my expectations and will purchase again.
16912,5,Negative,thank you
16930,5,Negative,Deliicous! Hard to find in stores.
16936,5,Negative,"My local co-op got me hooked on this rice, and then pulled it due to lack of customer demand. My fellow grocery shoppers don't know what they are missing. Lundberg Black Japonica smells heavenly while cooking, and produces a dense, chewy rice that is so flavorful you can eat it with just a little butter and salt."
16956,5,Negative,"WHEN I LOOK AT THIS PRODUCT I THINK 30 MINUTES TILL DINNER, ALL I HAVE TO DO IS WAIT FOR IT TO COOK."
16957,5,Negative,"Very aromatic and flavorful. I under cooked it the first time - I thought it was just a naturally crunch rice. I eventually managed to achieve the perfectly fluffy flavorful rice. You do need add salt, there's nothing worst than insipid rice."
16963,5,Negative,like it
16974,5,Negative,THIS RICE IS THE ONLY ONE I EAT AT HOME. SO NUTRITIOUS!
16978,5,Negative,I cook an entire bag of this rice and pour barbeque sauce on it. it's the closest thing to ground beef sloppy joe's without actually eating meat. i also sprinkle it on a salad for the chewy texture it gives.
16981,5,Negative,Bought it twice.
16989,5,Negative,I really like the Lundberg varieties of rice. The black japonica and black pearl are two of my favorites. I also enjoy the Burgundy rice. If you are tired of the boring taste of brown or white rice try these for a slightly nutty flavor.
16999,5,Negative,"Extremely tasty, slightly spendy."
17031,5,Negative,thank you!!
17035,5,Negative,"There's rice, and then there's THIS rice. Look no more."
17085,5,Negative,"My family enjoys this rice blend. It is good fixed with water as a plain side or prepared using a vegetable, chicken or beef stock instead of water. (The only difficulty I have had is getting the proper liquid to rice ratio when fixing the entire package at one time in a pressure cooker.) I will purchase again."
17109,5,Negative,Once you try this rice you will never want to go back to plain old white rice ever again. That's the truth.
17112,5,Negative,I buy this rice all the time and you can't beat the amazon price. I cook rice several times a week and I never get tired of it. Cooking with beef or chicken broth instead of just water makes it taste even better.
17118,5,Negative,This rice is part of a speciat treat that I have cooked for a few years. I can no longer find it in the stores.
17120,5,Negative,Cook it with broth or a little salt and pepper and BAM! it does take a while to cook about 45 min. What I did was slow cook chicken and about 1hour left I added the rice or bake the chicken with the rice add water and wait for hour and a half and BAM!! good eating..Well that is if your not a vegan.
17169,5,Negative,"I typically buy this product at Whole Foods Market, but found that it was less expensive when bought in bulk online. I mix the Lundberg Wehani with the Lundberg short grain brown rice (1 parts wehani, 3 parts short grain brown rice). It's hearty and yummy!"
17170,5,Negative,"This rice has a nice nutty flavor. It isn't bitter like some brown rices. For two people, I use the following recipe:6 oz rice2 cups low sodium chicken broth1 bay leaf1 tsb EVOOCook 50 minutes and rest for 10 minutesI'll add some saffron if I'm eating seafood.This rice is well worth the expense. And yes, I know it's 10 times as expensive as white rice."
17188,5,Negative,"Great Product....but not a good value for the price. This is 5 per pound here but at the market its 3.49. Makes no sense, sorry"
17195,5,Negative,"I am always searching for these old scrapbooks (11x14 with paper pages) to match the ones I began years ago. When I find them I buy them. The buff pages didn't suit me at all, but as I said above, I was desperate for the covers. I will now pay for paper to be cut and holes punched."
17197,5,Negative,My baby is very active and burns a lot of calories. Unfortunately his is a picky eater too. A friend suggested this yogurt and my baby loves it. This has become a staple in my home.
17204,4,Negative,"I buy these for stepson (28) as he refuses to try anything different, he uses these every load."
17205,4,Negative,Smells great...lasting scent
17213,5,Negative,"The product arrived just as advertised. Being an amazon prime member, the shipping was VERY slow as I had to wait a week and a half to get my order. Other than that, everything was fine!"
17225,5,Negative,"Bounce-Great smell..Use it in drawers, vents and the dryer. Gotta find a coupon to help save money...Highly recommend!!"
17245,5,Negative,Been using it for years and find that it works well in the Dryer!
17255,5,Negative,Don't just throw the sheets into the dryer. When those nasty biting bugs we have in Fl. just rub a bounce sheet on your clothes and keep the from biting!
17257,5,Negative,These are my go to dryer sheets!
17258,5,Negative,came on time
17265,5,Negative,Removes dog hair from my bed comforters!
17267,5,Negative,Excelent.
17270,5,Negative,I like the way it makes my clothes smell and they do not stick together
17271,5,Negative,I have used this product for a long time when drying my clothes....They help stop clinging and make your dried items smell fresh...dcstarlo
17274,5,Negative,"After the dryer sheets has been used as a fabric softener and all the freshness has been used up, spread the sheet out and flatten it. The flattened sheet can be reused in the dryer FILTER to filter out the lint in the dryer exhaust. Replace the used dryer sheet with each drying cycle and your dryer exhaust will never be clogged with dryer lint. This would be a possible sales product for BOUNCE for a slightly larger dryer filter sheet."
17284,5,Negative,it softens the cloths in dryer
17286,5,Negative,It was b grear
17296,5,Negative,"I HAVE TRIED JUST ABOUT EVERY MAKEUP ON THE SHELVES, AND I CAN'T GET OVER THE COVERAGE"
17354,4,Negative,It seems to wash out over time...unless I let it sit in my hair for at least 20 minutes
17361,4,Negative,"My natural hair color is black. I let it grow out for 10 years and most of it has turned white. Just needed to tone down all the white. The shocking part was it turned black immediately. Not the results I wanted even after only 5 minutes. The color is dull and looks fake. I only used it on the edges, sides and part of the front. Hopefully when I use my next application it will be the dark brown for a more natural look. Is this product a semi color and does it gradually go away. I would be really happy if it did."
17365,4,Negative,"I like it over the beard and moustache product because you can never seem to get the mix correct where you have used an equal amount of each and not run out of one. As an African-American, I think there is a market for a Grecian style formula that works on our hair which requires no coloring at all. Grecian claims it works on all hair but it does not."
17374,4,Negative,"make tube round, rather than oval, like tooth paste tube... Makes use awkward and difficult to line up comb attachment.... i have dropped the tube on many occasions and ruined the carpeting... Now I use a drop cloth..."
17375,4,Negative,"I use this product because I didn't wan to look like one of those guys that have artificial jet black hair. The product was so easy to use, and no one I work with even noticed right away. It does tend to fade a little between applications. Overall, I like the way it looks, and it is incredibly easy to apply."
17376,4,Negative,I have been using the Grey black color. It works well on me except that after about a week it turns reddish. My solution is to color again and then cut my hair very small to remove the reddish tones. When coloring I use a glove to apply it is much easier I have never used the comb that comes with it.
17378,4,Negative,"This product delivered as advertised, I would recommend it."
17384,4,Negative,"This was my first time using this product. The product worked as advertised. The process was simple and over in five minutes. The percent of color coverage was a little disappointing, but got better with each successive application."
17396,4,Negative,"After 4 weeks it leaves a a slight brownish color, why Using the black color touch of gray."
17397,4,Negative,Every 2 weeks or so I apply and it seems to stay about the same color and look descent.
17399,4,Negative,regular user. use the product monthly to keep me from looking totally gray.
17401,4,Negative,The product works well. My only issue is that I find it messy to use without help. I'm not sure what can be done about this but that is my only issue.
17413,4,Negative,"I only wish color lasted longer, My wife is the one that had me try it and is the reason I continue to use it."
17417,4,Negative,excelent product i do recommend it to all my friends
17418,4,Negative,Very messy to use. Stains floors counters tubs etc
17420,5,Negative,I have had about 3 years using this product and found it easy to use and less expensive then going to get it done professionally each tube you get approximately 3 application usage I have to color once per month I always purchase 6 boxes and always Have it around for touch up if needed would Recommend
17423,5,Negative,Does the job
17425,5,Negative,Up to the mark
17440,5,Negative,works very well and quick just a little to messy. have to theow half out
17449,5,Negative,"As stated above, this product works as advertised. I would like to see a specific touch of grey product for beards and mustaches made. Right now I use this product on both head and facial hair utilizing an old brush applicator vs. using the comb. I usually get 2-3 applications out of the tube before the dye totally turns black in the tube due to oxygen exposure and I have to toss it out..."
17468,5,Negative,"I wish I didn't have to throw some money away. I only use about 1/3 of the product bec at my age not much of my hair is left over my head. Too bad they don't have smaller packages, smaller packages would make this product a environmental safer product, very important this days."
17479,5,Negative,"I've been using TOUCH OF GRAY for the last 6 years and I receive compliments every time I use it. Which is monthly, only if it could last a little longer."
17482,5,Negative,"I'VE BEEN USING TOUCH OF GREY FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW. NOT MESSY I CAN DO IT IN A HURRY.MY WIFE SAYS IT SOFTENS THE COLOR AND MAKES ME LOOK A LITTLE YOUNGER, I ALSO COMB SOME THROUGH MY BEARD AND MUSTACHE."
17484,5,Negative,I like the product in that it gets rid of the right amount og grey an it lasts a reasonable period of timr (2-3 weeks). Only complaint is that it stains the skin and that the application is a little messy
17490,5,Negative,It colors in just enough gray to were your friends doubt if you use color or not.
17497,5,Negative,"Buy this product because in is not a hair coloring, dont like the fake look. This lets me keep gray look"
17513,5,Negative,like this product because it doesn't change your hair back all the way and leaves some gray which is less noticeable change
17514,5,Negative,I do not want wish to get all of the gray out of my hair just some This product does the job It promised.
17519,5,Negative,I LIVE BY THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE BLACK GREY HAIR BUT MOSTLY GREY AND THE PRODUCT ADDS SOME BLACK TO MY HAIR.
17542,5,Negative,"Remodeling bathroom now, but have not installed yet."
17588,5,Negative,Why is this item not offered in the store any longer
17591,5,Negative,See above
17623,4,Negative,It is not the translucent shade I expected. But I can use it.
17627,4,Negative,it keeps down the shine
17629,4,Negative,We could not find this in the store so we got it online
17643,5,Negative,I began using this powder several years ago and haven't found another powder that compares!
17655,5,Negative,"I have literally been using this powder for 30 years. And before that, my grandmother used it all her life. It's actually funny that the packaging still looks the same as the ones I remember in my grandmother's dressing area as a child. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find now, which makes me nervous that Coty might discontinue making this. I PRAY NOT! I have never worn liquid foundation and don't know what I'd do if this product was not available to purchase. I searched ULTA for anything comparable and you can find loose powder in about a quarter of an ounce container for 20! I may be exaggerating a tad, but you get the picture. I am spoiled by Coty and cannot recommend it enough!!!!!!!!!"
17662,5,Negative,Little goes a long way
17670,5,Negative,"It has a medicinal smell to it, which was a disappointment, because I happened to like the way it used to smell. Not sure why they changed that. Same great coverage where a little goes a LONG way. If you use too much, you look like a mannequin. Use sparingly."
17675,5,Negative,This powder has changed everything for me. It changed my makeup game. IF YOU DONT HAVE IT GET IT
17678,5,Negative,"No flashback, a little bit of a smell, but it doesn't linger."
17688,5,Negative,I've been using Coty's power for years and hope they never discontinue it. Your store is one of the few places it can be purchased....and hope you keep selling it.
17721,5,Negative,I use this instead of foundation. I just wash my face dry it a touch of powder and a bit of lipstick and I'm done.
17723,5,Negative,I took a class with a make up artist thats how I met this product
17738,5,Negative,I've. worn this since I was a teenager and still use to this day. It doesn't make me break out as others do.
17752,5,Negative,It covers well and lasts a long time. It is not shiny!
17772,4,Negative,"I should start by stating that I was hesitant to use a solid anti-perspirant deodorant, As I usually use a competitor's gel anti-perspirant. Images of stained shirts and white flakes all over my clothing is what came to mind before last week! For the past week I've been using Axe Phoenix anti-perspirant deodorant. I have to say, I love this! The deodorant formula, as well as the scent, is light, but lasts all day. The only problem is the deodorant itself tends to cake on the case/packaging after applying it, which can make a mess if you don't wipe it off before it dries. There's no flaking, or staining after application, or after a long day. All you need is a few strokes under each arm, and you are ready for the day. I run everyday, and this deodorant has not let me down! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
17783,4,Negative,Smells good and keeps my arm pit dry but bad idea to use it if you are gonna wear a black shirt. I would highly recommend it if you are wearing any other color. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
17809,5,Negative,I purchased this for my son and he loves it! So do I!!!
17842,5,Negative,Love this bars is a dessert I don't feel bad about
17869,5,Negative,No shrinkage
17880,5,Negative,I color my birds then cut them using a manic platform
17883,5,Negative,A must have to use with the stamp set.
17899,4,Negative,It moisturizes my lips extremely well and I use this on a daily basis. My lips are usually chap so this product helps me out a lot. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is very thick but that property also allows the product to last for a longer period of time.
17902,4,Negative,"Please, please, please make a squeeze tube! This is a fantastic product. It brought my extremely dry, flaky, painful lips back to life after moving to a dry, cold climate that was an extreme shock to my skin. I now use it before exercising in the winter air, before showering, etc., to prevent dry lips to begin with. It's genuinely the best product I've ever used to moisturize or protect my lips. But I can't give it 5 out of 5 because I really dislike having to dip my fingers into the jar so very much - and a makeup brush is annoying in the house and entirely impractical outside of the house."

17936,5,Negative,"I had no idea that Vaseline had a product just for lips. So my lips were cracked on both sides, so I tried it and 2 days later... My Lips We're Healed!!!"
17940,5,Negative,"I recently been suffering from extremely dry lips. I tried everything from eos, burts bees, baby lips etc... thought I wasn't going to find anything that would soothe my dry lips. I decided to try vaseline cocoa butter lips therapy. As soon as I applied it instantly made my lips smoother and softer. I absolutely love this product and recommend to anyone who suffers from dry chapped lips. Thank you for making this product!"
17958,5,Negative,"Where do I begin! I have eczema chronically, so my skin can be very sensitive. Recently, I saw my dermatologist because my face was AWFUL (breaking out, itchy, cracking, etc)... turns out, I had angular cheilitis, oral thrush, AND perioral dermatitis. What the heck! My doctor told me that most lip products further irritate the condition because of all the additives, so he recommended Vaseline. I tried the regular Vaseline, but it was too runny for me... but the Cocoa Butter Vaseline... WOW!! It applies thicker than the regular variety and soothes my irritated lips."
17959,5,Negative,"I bought this two days ago to help my chapped lips after having a bad cold/sinus infection. I blew my nose so many times my upper lip and my nose was cracked and red, and pretty painful. This instantly soothed my lips, and it's kinda funny, but I put it on the tip of my nose and upper lip too, and now my nose is almost completely healed! I tried everything to soothe my poor nose before, and the alcohol content of other creams burn! After two days it's a 360 transformation! This stuff is the bomb!"
17966,5,Negative,"I've been using the Vaseline Cocoa Butter Lip Therapy Tin that I received in my free Influenster December VoxBox for the past couple of days and I'm in love. My lips have been extremely chapped from our horrible weather lately and product that I had been using didn't provide any relief at all. As soon as I received the box in the mail I put it on right away and I've been reapplying ever since. I'm on day 3 now and my chapped lips are now soft, smooth and very kissable (at least that's what the hubby says). This review was collected as part of a promotion."
17971,5,Negative,This product is literally a lifesaver. I have the worst chapped lips over the winter and this product completely changes that (almost instantly!) I was experiencing some dryness after using a different product and starting using Vaseline and the dryness went away within a day. Will never use another product!
17972,5,Negative,Me and my babygirl use this product and it works wonders on the lips...AWESOME
17981,5,Negative,"Every winter my lips become painfully chapped. 10x worse then my husband or kids I'm not sure why. Every year I rush to the store to find some relief! This year I wanted to get ahead of it and get chapstick before my lips got bad. Vaseline lip therapy Cocoa butter caught my attention, I absolutely LOVE IT! My lips haven't chapped AT ALL which is a blessing. I don't have to contenuassly apply it so that's always a plus and the smell and feel of it is lovely. Before I found this my lips became painfully chapped and embarrassing. I hated to kiss my husband cause of how they felt and looked. Now thanx to this product I havent have that problem. I NEVER EVER write reviews especially this long HAHA but I assure you this product is amazing."

18257,5,Negative,"I have very little pigment to my lips so the color endless red brings life back into my lips! For someone who owns mostly high end make up products, these drugstore lip stains are a staple! Can't wait to try the other colors. I also like that they don't dry out my lips and last a very long time."
18292,5,Negative,Loed it!!

18437,4,Negative,This product does not make your hair sticky or overly wet. Use sparingly and directly to the area that you want to lift.
18441,5,Negative,"I have spent a small fortune on products that claim to give my thin hair volume. This one is one that does exactly what it says it will do. Not stiff, but, when they say Instant, that is what it is. It is the best on 2nd day hair. I will never be without this. On the 2nd day, my hair does not look dirty and oily, it is still ok, but needs a little lift, and a few sprays and it is like I just washed and styled it. I would pay 3 times the price, so glad to get it for 4.00. You will not be disappointed, promise. Usually when I put spray in my hair, the next day it feels dirty, not with this, it is absolutely amazing."

20174,5,Negative,I only buy clorox disinfecting wipes to wipes down areas that are constantly being touched by my children's small hands and where all of us tend to be in contact with in general.

I use the wipes to clean the car of germs (carpet, upholstery and vinyl) after the trips and before using the proper auto treatments. I go to thrift stores a lot and I just hate the way my hands feel and look when I come out so I use them to clean my hands and arms and sometimes my finds before I put them in the car. You never know what germs you may be taking home! I work temp jobs and I'm always skeptical that I may be there because someone went home sick so I take my wipes with me to thoroughly clean the desk, phone and area I will work in. I notice that my kids, now grown, and close friends and family are carrying them around. I could go on and on about Clorox wipes."
20300,5,Negative,"Take it from someone that will take the time to fold up a number of wipes and put them in a plastic baggie for travel- you need a travel size!

20608,4,Negative,"Would not accept Amazon or PayPal checkout no matter what I tried. What gives, is it an Apple Safari issue . Order went though with MC, hope it works."
20614,5,Negative,The proof is in the pudding. I await your follow through.
20659,4,Negative,I finally found a dandruff shampoo with a matching conditioner!
20662,4,Negative,"So, as person who struggles with dandruff, I feel like it has to be really hard to come up with a product that helps the scalp without drying out the hair. This conditioner was that! It left my hair still feeling conditioned afterwards, and that is something I don't feel like I've always gotten with dandruff products!"
20673,4,Negative,I have never used a separate conditioner product before this review. The conditioner seems to do its job well enough however I prefer my shampoo and conditioner to be all in one. That being said the product is solid. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
20681,4,Negative,"Okay, so I'm not hugely concerned about my hair. What I mean to say is, I've never used conditioner before. Just the store brand dandruff shampoo that's it. Since I've started using the Head Shoulders Shampoo Conditioners though, I have noticed an improvement of the look of my hair plus I no longer have an itch, dry scalp. I do feel as if the conditioner helps my hair look nicer longer, but not sure what it is doing for my scalp. But either way it's working. I was concerned how similar the conditioner bottle looked to the shampoo. Without my glasses, I was worried I wouldn't know which was which, since the designs are just opposites of the other. So far though, this hasn't been a problem. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
20693,5,Negative,"I've been using the Head Shoulders conditioner side-by-side with their shampoo. I have been a firm believer that hair shouldn't be washed every day for fear of drying out. After using the conditioner every day, I learned I was wrong. I can shampoo and condition my hair every day, and my hair will stay healthy and soft, even after it has dried. I have faith that my hair will not dry out, and that the conditioner will work with Head Shoulder's shampoo to fight any dandruff. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
20736,4,Negative,"Keeps dry skin at bay, while keeps the smell of summer year round."
20759,5,Negative,"I am going through menopause and it is taking my hair out. I use it 3 times a week on the edges of my hair and I see a really big difference, now when I braid my hair I can actually catch all of the edges! Bravo Cococare"
20760,5,Negative,As advertised
20764,5,Negative,This product is just what I have been looking for; heats just my personal space and its quiet.
20767,5,Negative,"I bought this heater to put under the office desk for my cold feet. It is small enough that it does not take up much space, and has low watts so it does not trip the breaker."
20782,4,Negative,"If you like salt and vinegar chips, these are salted and vinegared and they are chips. Mission accomplished. If you don't like pretending to eat salted douche on potato products, these are not for you. Mission failed."
20789,4,Negative,Seems to be a quality product. Wish the keys to the lock were a bit heavier tho.
20814,4,Negative,"The firebox is of decent size and can really churn out the heat on cold nights if the chimney drafts like it's supposed to.I am, however, slightly disappointed by the firebox opening. It is smaller than the door glass suggests. 18 inches wide and 10 inches tall is the real firebox opening.I suggest getting this model due to its efficiency and built in heat shield. The blower is mostly unused, if you crack the door just a bit, the airflow from the evacuation-by-fire is more than enough to stoke the stove."
20839,5,Negative,Seems well built. If I had to do over I would buy the next size bigger
20855,4,Negative,"The chips are tasty, without the need of a dip. Unfortunately, they were improperly shipped, and the chips were badly cracked. Some were reduced to less than a third their packaged size and, in some cases, little more than powder."
20858,4,Negative,My fault I shouldn't have gotten plain. They are very plain
20906,4,Negative,We use it to dip sauce.
20907,4,Negative,I like them
20908,4,Negative,Used with Taco Salad
20917,4,Negative,"this item was not eatable. when I received it the chips were all crushed, because they hae been crammed in to a space that was too small for the package."
20919,4,Negative,Go to brand for tortilla chips...full chips in the bag rather than a bag of crumbs. I only wish they'd do zip lock tops without jacking up the price.
20923,4,Negative,There were a lot of broken chips
20926,4,Negative,only brand I buy
20933,5,Negative,Salsa
20940,5,Negative,Yummy Yummy for the tummy:P
20941,5,Negative,I like the salty and crunchy taste.

21075,5,Negative,"I don't buy any tortilla chip, but these. They are always crunchy."
21079,5,Negative,Tostitos chips are my go to chip no exception!
21082,5,Negative,They hold up with whatever dip you are serving.
21092,5,Negative,My husband loves these chips! They're just the right size and are very thin.
21096,5,Negative,"Myself, I've never been disappointed by a Frito Lay product."
21097,5,Negative,Yum
21104,5,Negative,"My granddaughter loves these chips, she dunks them in sour cream!"
21115,5,Negative,"Just to point out an area for improvement, my only issue was that while Walmart.com broke up shipment into several smaller shipments, 4 bags of tostitos were placed in the same box with 4 cans of Campbell Chunky Soup. This seems like a bad combination and as expected broken up pretty well and one bag was actually opened due to this and I won't eat because I'm not sure if safe. So, that sounds bad, but while broken up, what are left are very fresh and not too bad for a several thousand mile trip. Overall very happy, haven't seen a tortilla chip in 2 months!!"
21130,5,Negative,"Like the round edges alot. I am not used to salting my foods/snacks/etc. so to me they are/or can be a little toooo salty for me.. but that's how I roll. I just do NOT ever use salt ...anymore... for .. oh maybe 30+ to 40 years, now. I do like the crunchie chips tho !!"
21783,4,Negative,"I have to admit that I was a little skeptical receiving this gel courtesy of Influenster to review. I have natural 4C texture hair that's super thick and curly. This gel defined and held my curls nicely without all the common negatives that I run into. My hair didn't have residue, wasn't weighed down, and my curls weren't crunchy. This is my first Nexxus product and I must say that I'm definitely a believer! This review was collected as part of a promotion."
21802,5,Negative,Would definitely recommend.
21862,5,Negative,Yummy!
21869,5,Negative,My kid is allergic to tree nuts and these are the only cookies he can have that don't bother his allergy.

21873,5,Negative,Always buy these for my husband. They are his favorites.
21874,5,Negative,"Nothing like a cold glass of milk and some yummy Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies before bedtime. A little thin, but still great taste."
21876,5,Negative,My son loves these. Let's just say they were gone in one day.
21886,5,Negative,I have been eating these cookies forever and they taste just like they always did.
21891,5,Negative,"Cookies By sandy cheeks This week of school in Ms.Hickok class we were taste testing three different brand of cookies Chips Ahoy,Sunny Select, and Keebler Deluxe. As 20 students taste cookies all students write down what they are smelling,touching,tasting,and seeing the class will write down information and review this information onto walmart.com . What the cookies had in common was they were all very similar size and had all had very crunchy texture and had and was a hard cookie"
21892,5,Negative,My family loves them
21898,5,Negative,These are a real treat with a tall glass of cold milk.

21937,5,Negative,"It work well,"
21952,5,Negative,"I have been using this soap for years, and I mean years! I will use no other! I have wore down a bar of soap to the size of a dime in between purchases! That's why I bought in bulk this time! I gave the scent a poor rating because, the scent seems to be much stronger than it used to be, and I have emphysema, so it bothers me a lot. The newer scents are worse for me! But, to each his own, as they say! Why can't they make things like they used to But, I still will not switch to any other brand of soap! Thanks!"
21959,5,Negative,I've tried a lot of different kinds of soap and I keep coming back to caress bar soap.
21960,5,Negative,Soothing soap
21962,5,Negative,I would recommend to everyone
21975,5,Negative,"I recently purchased Caress body wash. I was amazed to see the variety of fragrances. Caress not only cleans the body, but it nourishes as well."
21990,5,Negative,Works great and instant on. not sure about the bad reviews for flickering on a dimmer. This is not a dimmer compatible bulb so yes it will flicker with a dimmer or if you have the wrong type of dimmer switch. You need an LED dimmer for LED bulbs.
22033,4,Negative,"The product smells good and is refreshing, but the packaging is horrible. the cap is hard to use and then it broke off and the body wash spilled all over. Keep the product, but work on the packaging."
22069,5,Negative,Makes you feel glamorous. Skin glows.
22085,5,Negative,"I bought this extra heavy duty grate for my patio fire pit because the last 2 standard ones didn't last for more than one season each. After a few uses, the steel would actually bend until it was sitting on the concrete which then makes it worthless. This grate is made with 3/4 inch square steel bar. I have used it twice now and I don't think that it will fail like the others, it is a very large and heavy beast! It is a bit expensive for what it is, but it should last many winters so it will be cheaper in the long run."
22092,5,Negative,a well made grate.right size for logsgrate keep log from falling out
22093,5,Negative,"Needed a wide grate and this one holds my logs perfectly. Heavy duty, well built."
22127,5,Negative,I have used alot of lotions and creams on my hands-and this stuff works wonders!
22157,5,Negative,My problematic skin loves it.
22164,5,Negative,"I simply adore this lotion and its fragrance, as does my husband. I'm allergic to so many perfumes and this one seems to skip by my nasal sensitivities. I'm sad that it doesn't come in a larger pump bottle any longer. I bought a dozen so I could refill my old pump bottle. I also like to carry the smaller tubes in the car with me. My hands couldn't be softer and my nails do seem to crack less using this product."
22205,5,Negative,"It is a holiday tradition to have our Poppy seed cake (recipe on back of the label) which we cover with buttercream frosting! You cant go wrong here and we've made this cake several times a year since I was a little boy and now im 54! Im not familiar with other uses, but Solo filling is consistent high quality."
22232,4,Negative,This is a movie that is different from any of his movies!!
22234,4,Negative,i like that perry can not only play well in comedy but also in a thriller.
22241,4,Negative,this dvd allows Tyler Perry to demonstrate his acting abilities as a homicide detective.
22262,4,Negative,"A change for the star of the movie, and also was filmed in Detroit."
22263,4,Negative,I have read every Alex Cross novel in print. This movie should have squeals.
22268,4,Negative,Usually don't like a movie when reading the book first. This movie is an exception.
22272,4,Negative,"Tyler Perry as Alex Cross, is a convincing a homicide detective/psychologist in Detroit who must track down a serial killer. This is a high-stakes game of cat and mouse that is both terrifying and personal. This thriller will challenge your ethical/psychological boundaries!"
22278,4,Negative,A man and his family being stalked by a hit man killer.
22279,4,Negative,Tyler Perry did well playing Alex Cross. He didn't disappoint taking over the role.
22283,4,Negative,"I purchased this because I love this book series. I was a little disappointed, but I got it on sale so that helps."
22284,4,Negative,I didn't expect the sad and sick twists and turns... nor the depth of the actors' performances... Not your usual buddy cop action movie... Well worth watching.
22290,5,Negative,Any fan of Tyler Perry should get this movie or one of his plays.
22299,5,Negative,I like the author's books and the movie was well done.
22303,5,Negative,"It is sort a mystery movie, it throws you for a loop and is not your traditional Tyler Perry movie."
22304,5,Negative,A different role for Tyler Perry something you will watch again and again
22313,5,Negative,The story line and subplots bring the story to life to include the human nature of each character's struggle with their inner feelings and maintaining an objective outlook in order to solve the crimes. It would not mr a difference if the book is read before or after. Reading the book will only enhance the the movie experience.
22328,5,Negative,"My husband loves Alex Cross, so he is really looking forward to watching this movie. How can you go wrong for under $2.00!"
22336,5,Negative,This is a must see!! Tyler Perry did his thing in this movie!!!
22350,5,Negative,Movie is a movie u can watch over and over again!!!! And azz low as price was shoulda got 2
22587,4,Negative,Very hard to get all the shampoo or conditioner out when the bottle is wet and hard to squeeze
22588,4,Negative,Love the product but hate the bottle it comes in. Hard to get out. Wish they would change the bottle....
22633,5,Negative,"So I was afraid it wouldn't work for me anymore from all the reviews of it changing its formula. But it is still the ONLY shampoo and conditioner that takes care of my dandruff overnight. I went months without it (apparently not in any stores near me anymore...) and the dandruff was INSANE- I was ready to just shave my head, it was horrible. But day 1 after using this shampoo and conditioner again my hair was light, fluffy, and soft again and the dandruff started drying up and falling off completely. 2 weeks in and I'm still in heaven. NO MORE ITCH!!! 3 3"
22694,5,Negative,I can't wait to wash my hair again. I'm impatient to try some new products
22696,5,Negative,"I am so disappointed in the last purchase I made, the conditioner was nothing like what it has been for the last few years, I hope this is just a bad bottle, I want to keep buying it, but if they have changed the product, I will not buy it anymore."
22713,5,Negative,I've tried all the drug store brands and it either leaves my hair very dry and hard to comb or very soft but super flat and limp. Total Care is a miracle for my hair makes my hair soft/shiny and easy to comb through while not making it flat and limp. I no longer have to spend a fortune on salon brands to get the results I want. The only complaint I have is that it's hard to get the conditioner out of the bottle. Please change the bottle but not the formula. Thank you Clear Scalp Hair Beauty Therapy!
22739,5,Negative,My daughter loves them
22740,5,Negative,My son loves them a lot.
22747,5,Negative,Muy caliente
22761,5,Negative,Grandson loves and goes through a bag every couple of days if we let him.
22782,5,Negative,My husband likes it
22790,4,Negative,I like to make pancake from this mix for because of the low sugar content (2 gram)
22791,4,Negative,The misses uses it all the time.
22796,4,Negative,Used this for years
22797,4,Negative,"Use this for pancakes, waffles and biscuits all the time."
22800,5,Negative,Can make a verity
22831,5,Negative,A item that helps make lots of things.
22834,5,Negative,I always buy
22837,5,Negative,Who doesnt like pancakes
22839,5,Negative,Use it all the time. Such fluffy pancakes!
22855,5,Negative,Since I can remember my mom always use Bisquick so I always watched her in the kitchen making things with Bisquick. As I grew up I didn't think there would be any difference but there is a huge difference. Even when the budgets a little bit tight and I tend to gravitate towards lesser priced items there's no comparison even if you can save a few cents here and there Bisquick is the way to go!
22861,5,Negative,"My mother raised us on Bisquick because my grandmother (her mom) used it all HER life! Biscuits, dumplings, cobbler crusts and breading fried chicken! I can't live without Bisquick in my pantry!"
22869,5,Negative,I love Bisquick for pancakes biscuits and chicken and dumplings
22883,5,Negative,"I have psoriasis very bad for at least 10 years tried everything nothing work except Olivella Virgin body face soap bar, truly remarkable. You Must try it!!!!!!!"
23328,4,Negative,"I liked this version of the fire-spewing giant , who sides with humanity to battle against equally terrifying beasts."
23345,4,Negative,"My only complaint, Godzilla didn't get enough screentime! Should of been introduced sooner and it seems like we saw too much human backstory and the other monster!"
23413,4,Negative,"Movie starts a little slow, but the second half is a solid (almost throwback) monster mash."
23426,4,Negative,"They got his snout and feet wrong and there wasn't enough of Godzilla fighting the other monsters. But, it was Godzilla and I have a soft spot for the big guy."
23436,4,Negative,America's redemption for that awful 90's Godzilla movie. This for monster fans and classic Zilla fans alike.
23437,4,Negative,Godzilla makes a triumphant return as he is here not just to stomp all over San Francisco but to also defend it.
23448,4,Negative,"This entry in the Godzilla series calls back to the older horror style entries of Godzilla. The big complaint everyone had with the movie was the limited screen time of Godzilla, but this just adds to the impact of the monster when he does appear. It creates tension and dread in the human characters as the audience sees the horrible consequences of each encounter. Don't worry though, the last act of the movie really shows off Godzilla and what he's capable of."
23460,4,Negative,I love the characters and the two other creatures that was evil.
23489,4,Negative,"Godzilla and the Monsters are definitely the stars of the show, but following the random marine around is pretty pointless. They could have taken him out of the picture, and the movie would have probably been better."
23491,4,Negative,A definite improvement over the 1998 version of Godzilla
23493,4,Negative,Solid monster film when Godzilla is on screen but drops in quality because of some lackluster performances.
23511,4,Negative,This is a movie that I could watch over and over again.
23512,4,Negative,"The movie stayed true to the godzilla stories of old. Sometimes he is a good guy, sometimes a bad guy. The storyline wasn't bad either."
23513,4,Negative,Purchased this movie for my husband and he loves it. Two thumbs up.
23516,4,Negative,This entry into the Godzilla franchise is not perfect but still worth a viewing. My main gripe is that Bryan Cranston is so underutilized
23551,4,Negative,"Now this is how Godzilla should be... big, bad and almost unstoppable."
23560,4,Negative,Godzilla brought back to the big screen............
23561,4,Negative,"Who is ""king of the monsters? Giant monsters and family drama brings this pic to life."
23578,4,Negative,"Harkins back to the OG Godzilla with a slow but detailed story,before the big bad himself steps to the screen to bash the some what lame un design bad guy monster's."
23615,4,Negative,acting was weak. the beginning and end is the only parts worth watching
23630,4,Negative,It takes awhile to develop but once it does you're captivated.
23634,4,Negative,"This movie is a bit of slow burn, but it pays off at the end."
23702,4,Negative,Definitely tried to get back to earlier godzilla movies
23743,4,Negative,"Maybe not for a hardcore ""made in Japan"" Godzilla fans, still wort your time."
23744,4,Negative,"I missed the movie in the theater, I waited until it came out on DVD."
23755,4,Negative,"Love the movie, just hate how generic Godzilla was"
23765,4,Negative,Its your typical Godzilla movie takes forever to get to the monsters. I would recommend pacific rim if you like big monsters. But I like the godzilla franchise. My son loves the movie so maybe I'm too critical.
23798,4,Negative,This is a well put together movie that let's you sit back and be entertained.
23802,4,Negative,I found this movie funnier then scary. I did enjoy the monster battles.
23831,4,Negative,A massively enjoyable movie for fans and casual movie watchers alike!
23838,4,Negative,This movie stars off slow but then is no stop thrilling.
23860,4,Negative,We bought the 3D version of Godzilla and it wasn't too bad. Kids liked it and kept our interest.
23870,4,Negative,The last seen was a little drawn out. Other than that it was a decent movie
23872,4,Negative,I do wish it had commentary by the director or the cast.
23905,4,Negative,I really expected it to be the follow up to the Godzilla in New York city so that was a little disappiointing.
23913,4,Negative,Although the action was good the idea behind the movie was an updated version of past Godzilla meets monsters movie. the 3 D version was not a true 3 D picture so I was disappointed.
23914,4,Negative,This movie finally brought Godzilla back. 3-d isn't entirely necessary.
23927,4,Negative,"Godzilla destroys San Francisco, then leaves, typical tourist."
23933,4,Negative,"Was pleasantly surprised by this movie, especially since the last one was bad. Reminds of the old Godzilla I used to watch when I was younger."
23940,4,Negative,Creature was done well. I was a big Godzilla fan growing up. This one did the monster justice.
23943,4,Negative,Hesitant after last fiasco of a movie on Godzilla but this one won't won't be a waste of time.
23963,4,Negative,It annoys me up to hear critics and people complaining about the dramatic depth of the human characters. THIS IS A GODZILLA MOVIE...AND IT RULES!!! leave it at that
23969,4,Negative,Thank GOD! they made this movie to get rid of that last crapshow
23983,4,Negative,Had seen in theaters. My grandson watches the Godzilla movies with me so I purchased this for us to watch together.
23999,4,Negative,I recommend this movie if you like mystery and sci fi.
24002,4,Negative,"who doesn't like big scary monsters!! what I expected from a movie like this.. just fun, lots of damage and GODZILLA!!!"
24005,4,Negative,"I think some of the reviewers were right when they said Godzilla was a little chubby compared to past versions. I thought this one was way better than the last, that one was bad. The people did more damage trying to kill it than Godzilla did itself. Having Bryan Cranston playing a bigger or longer role in the movie may have brought it up a notch. All in all it was too bad."
24032,4,Negative,How can you go wrong with Godzilla an action packed movie
24039,4,Negative,Enjoyed this in the theater and at home. Can't go wrong with this.
24059,4,Negative,A must have for anyone who likes the monster Godzilla.
24096,4,Negative,"Everyone else in the house was hoping it wasn't going to turn into the last Godzilla movie. And it didn't. My only disappointment was *Spoiler Alert* Bryan Cranston dying so early on. I was looking forward to him being in the entire movie. Having said that, I really liked this one (other than that one thing) and am actually looking forward to the next one."
24129,4,Negative,"I was surprised that the movie wasn't that bad, for a godzilla movie. Was Def better then the one previously made."
24144,4,Negative,I was worried it would not live up to what I remember but it did.
24160,4,Negative,"godzilla for once is not the enemy against mankind, instead he's the protector of any threats to humanity"
24169,4,Negative,"He does it again!! He is always made out to be the bad guy, guess he shows them differently."
24183,4,Negative,A solid movie with a weak lead actor (human) but a solid star in Godzilla.
24190,4,Negative,this t.v. was purchased as a christmas gift and as of this message has not been used
24192,4,Negative,"A Godzilla movie that was tailor made for Toho fans, NOT the summer blockbuster crowd..."
24208,4,Negative,Movie was on sale and cheaper than amazon so I picked it up. Wish the dvd copies came with digital copies though.
24221,4,Negative,"If you're a Godzilla fan, as I am, you know already. This is a terrific reboot/reimagining of the King of the Kaiju. It's faithful enough to the original concept for the purists, with enough over-the-top destruction to warrant the update. If you're not into monster movies, you're probably not going to get into this."
24241,4,Negative,My husband is a fan of Godzilla for years. We had seen terrible take of American version of Godzilla story but this one did not disappoint us.
24250,4,Negative,"I liked this movie, but not loved it. It was difficult to get the first time I watched it."
24253,4,Negative,bryan cranston is the man.too bad he didn't get a little more screen time in this film
24258,4,Negative,Better than a lot of the godzilla movies that have came out in the past it starts out slow but picks up
24259,4,Negative,Godzilla has come a long way since the days of black and white
24271,4,Negative,"My son LOVES this movie, so getting a digital copy is a MUST for kindle. Blue ray, dvd, and digital for under $10"
24274,4,Negative,Had to have this...been a fan of Godzilla since the 90's
24278,4,Negative,Got this movie during the black Friday sale..a well made choice.
24288,4,Negative,I was waiting for this to go on sale. Bought it on Thanksgiving night.We watched it the next night with the grandkids. It kept their interest
24292,4,Negative,Movie is fun but sometimes is slow paced and godzilla appears very briefly throughout the movie.
24303,4,Negative,Not a bad movie...some things were questionable about the movie but still viewable.
24318,4,Negative,"Plot moves a little slow and not a lot of Godzilla time on screen, overall I'd still rate this movie 4 stars."
24334,4,Negative,Didnt know what to make of this movie until I saw it. Decent remake where others have failed
24361,4,Negative,The beginning grabs you well enough to make you hold on until the end...
24362,4,Negative,product as described works as expected no issues with this
24364,4,Negative,Reminding me of when I was a young child and I would watch Godzilla vs Monthra on KTLA. Just an updated version with more explosions. Not to bad of a movie.
24379,4,Negative,Two words Godzilla and bluray enough said watch this movie
24395,4,Negative,This Godzilla crushed the last one that was made 15 years ago.
24403,4,Negative,Expensive at first release but I caught it on sale.
24417,4,Negative,A little different twist on the age-old monster story!
24418,4,Negative,My kids like the movie............................
24419,4,Negative,Good graphics and storyline the main characters did not make stupid decisions that usually drive me crazy
24432,4,Negative,I remember Saturday afternoons waiting to watch Godzilla. Epic moments. I see the original films now and wonder why was I so afraid. The remakes in my opinion have been horrible until now. Loved this movie.
24459,4,Negative,"Overall, a terrific film. It's a shame that the actors that made me want to see it (Cranston, Binoche, Watanabe) are hardly in it. in stead we have to follow Aaron Johnson and Elizabeth olsons characters who unfortunately are not that interesting.However, the effects, action sequences and direction all make up for it's character shortcomings."
24466,4,Negative,I bought this for my younger son who loves Godzilla
24523,5,Negative,"Well made remake. Fun movie to watch, not too scary for kids."
24539,5,Negative,I would recommend this movie to any 3-D movie buff
24555,5,Negative,I grew up watching Godzilla on TV and bought this for my nephew. It was a hit with him!
24560,5,Negative,"I read some complaints by people who didn't like the late appearance of Godzilla. This wasn't a problem for me. The filmmakers were setting up the situation and this new interpretation of Godzilla. They then brought back the King of the Monsters, a force of nature, in all his near-indestructible glory. The human parts of the story are a tad hackneyed, but they work because Godzilla movies are about the people affected by the actions of the creatures."
24571,5,Negative,Picked up movie in store after buying online. Had no issues in the experience.
24579,5,Negative,Another must have movie for my home library........
24587,5,Negative,What would we do without Godzilla! Where would it go next?
24600,5,Negative,Godzilla was my childhood and I'm so glad they redeemed every bad Godzilla movie I saw when I was younger. This made up for all of it!
24616,5,Negative,If you are a big Gozilla fan then you need to watch this movie
24619,5,Negative,"This is a no-brainer. Pick this one up, ASAP! GODZILLA!"
24636,5,Negative,"If you are a Godzilla movie fan, you will like this movie."
24699,5,Negative,"Do I review the movie or the product? I don't know. Anyway, GREAT MOVIE! Silly dialogue. Walter White is a conspiracy theorist. Quicksilver squints and pouts that he's too slow to do much. Godzilla's fat but still has it, and Asain people are still afraid of Gojira."
24706,5,Negative,As a life long Godzilla fan this is one movie I couldn't pass up. Godzilla saves the world from monsters and does some landscaping in the process.
24708,5,Negative,This movie is one of my all-time favorites. Godzilla is Back!!
24775,5,Negative,bought it for a friend who is a godzilla nut. xmas gift
24789,5,Negative,Grandson has watched the movie several times and loves it
24810,5,Negative,Being a fan of Monster Movies and Godzilla growing up. I knew I had to get this movie for my dvd collection!
24811,5,Negative,The start of the monster movie universe. A must!!!
24820,5,Negative,"Finally, a movie that does Godzilla justice. The CGI doesn't look fake. The camera angles on the shots give it realism! The story/plot of the main character becomes interwoven methodically. If you're a fan of the Godzilla, this is a must."
24824,5,Negative,"It doesn't state it on the packaging but, my copy included a Digital Copy of the movie. Definitely a plus"
24829,5,Negative,"Finally, a Godzilla movie that pays respect to the classics."
24830,5,Negative,I've waited for the proper Godzilla and this one delivered!!!
24844,5,Negative,Man this movie is awesome...sure there is not enough godzilla in it but when the king of monsters is there you can feel the impact he makes...
24861,5,Negative,"Spoiler alert this movie ties in with Kong Skull Island, Monarch is as it again"
24869,5,Negative,Again adding to my bluray collection.Been a fan of Godzilla since I was little.
24880,5,Negative,If you watch King King.... You have to watch Godzilla
24887,5,Negative,"Movie starts slow but picks up, very action packed"
24917,5,Negative,"Well it's godzilla, what else is there to say, King of the Monsters returns"
24918,5,Negative,I was expecting junk but this movie rocks! Pick it up.
24923,5,Negative,I have always been a big fan of Godzilla and always will be
24927,5,Negative,"I missed this in the theatre, so i had to pick it up.It's a godzilla movie so you know what you're going to get from the start. I always buy the packs like this so i can get the digital, Blu ray and the DVD"
24942,5,Negative,What can we say....Godzilla is the King of monsters! AWESOME MOVIE!!! Not like the stupid iguana flic!!!
24977,5,Negative,"I saw this movie in the theater twice, couldn't wait till it came out. Watched it again with my girlfriends kids the other night. They loved it too. the only bad thing is it takes Godzilla so long to make his arrival!"
24978,5,Negative,I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the original..Superbly done...
24987,5,Negative,Godzilla is still the King of Monster's now who's next.... Now Just Bring It
24993,5,Negative,Godzilla is back and in a big way. Don't mess around with the big G
25013,5,Negative,This reminds me of being a little girl watching the Japanese version
25045,5,Negative,Good....movie......................................
25050,5,Negative,Now this is the godzilla I've been waiting for. If you're not an old school fanatic then this is not for you.
25064,5,Negative,"This movie was so much better than the Mathew Broderick version. If that left a bad taste in your mouth, this one will make up for it!"
25073,5,Negative,I couldn't wait to see this movie! It was what I thought it would be! I would definitely recommend this movie to watch!
25078,5,Negative,"I actually felt like I was watching a monster movie, not just a giant dinosaur running around the city"
25119,5,Negative,"(minimum required characters: 50), (minimum required characters left: 17), (minimum required characters left: 17), (minimum required characters left: 17)"
25175,5,Negative,The movie is awesomegreat features and recommended
25177,5,Negative,This reboot of the Godzilla francise exceeded all my expectations!
25193,5,Negative,Godzilla as it was meant to be! ...without Matthew Broderick!!!
25198,5,Negative,I can't wait until they start filming Godzilla VS. King Kong!!!
25213,5,Negative,this completes my collection of Godzilla movies until the next one is released
25328,5,Negative,I have seen it in the movie theaters and wanted to add it to my movie collection.
25363,5,Negative,Finally Godzilla has been reborn to the awesomness i grew up watching in the 80's
25393,5,Negative,The King of Monsters has returned!!! Looking forward to seeing future movies in the franchise!
25436,5,Negative,Great movie - love the fact they mad Godzilla the hero instead of the bad guy - KINDA
25499,5,Negative,Godzilla (2014) This is a bad Godzilla..... it don't look like the old one the kids look at it over and over.......This is the new Godzilla.
25503,5,Negative,"When asking why things happen in the world the way they do, find some answers in this movie, and its sequel."
25505,5,Negative,Solid beginning for the franchise can't wait for the sequel!!!! It's the KIIIINNNNGGGG of monsters that is.....
25509,5,Negative,Godzilla you remember from childhood! A must see!!
25524,5,Negative,It is a Blast to see GodzillaWipe out WaikikiKind of weirdSeeing the actorFrom Breaking Bad
25533,5,Negative,It had a plot and didn't drag on to get to the point. This movie had the CGI version of the man in a rubber suit. It was nostalgic.
25551,5,Negative,Been a Godzilla Fan for Decades!!! This movie is a Keep!!!!
25591,5,Negative,I recommend this movie. Well done! A movie that you can watch over and over.
25592,5,Negative,"If you are looking for a movie that is just plain fun to watch, this is it! If you are looking for a boring, Oscar winning movie, you will be disappointed. Don't take life so seriously and get this movie and enjoy."
25653,5,Negative,This was a gift for my Dad. He loves the movie and watches it all the time.
25655,5,Negative,The movie exceeded my expectations it kept my interest fro the entire movie
25658,5,Negative,There isn't anything bad that I can say. The movie comes with a DVD and Blu-Ray copy. I can watch the Blu-Ray in my room and the kids can watch the DVD in their room.
25680,5,Negative,Awsome movie. Ilove the way the made godzilla. Wish they have shown godzilla from the begining fitghing
25693,5,Negative,"Didn't think I would like this movie but, it was awesome!p"
25729,5,Negative,This is the Godzilla movie I've been waiting years for!
25730,5,Negative,I would definitely recommend this movie to a friend.
25731,5,Negative,My daughter and i love this movie. You cant go wrong with Blue Atomic Fire
25736,5,Negative,Simply a must see for all Godzilla fans!!!!!!!!!!!!
25747,5,Negative,"I was told when i was paying for the dvd that they heard some people didn't like the movie, we watched it ( about 3 times that week) and only have this to say ""it's Godzilla - enough said"""
25755,5,Negative,The one I grew up with... The lizard you wanna cheer for.
25796,5,Negative,One of the few movies I was looking forward too this summer.
25817,5,Negative,Go see this if nothing else you can root for Godzilla as its a plus!
25850,5,Negative,"I admit. My only other experience with Godzilla was that poor attempt in the late '90s, so I was understandably wary with this release. Boy am I relieved that I'm not alone in shunning the '90s version (if you could call it that)! This movie packs action with a solid story line; the pace was somewhat slow to start, but picks up as the movie goes on. Good choice for a movie night with friends."
25863,5,Negative,There's a big monster in Japan. A husband and Wife work together.
25883,5,Negative,If you are a fan of godzilla man this movie is beastttttt.
25891,5,Negative,"My only complaint is the fact that the movie focuses a bit too much on the humans instead of the monsters, hopefully the sequel will fix this."
25894,5,Negative,A dark tale of nuclear power gone wrong. The G-Man comes to the rescue and displays his terrible temper and rampage.
25902,5,Negative,Not understanding all the hate on this movie. It is amazing.
25920,5,Negative,Product worked perfectly. Movie was a B-. Plot was awful.
25928,5,Negative,Very different than any other Godzilla movie. It's been modernized
25950,5,Negative,miss it in cinema so I bought it for watching at home.
25956,5,Negative,This is an action packed movie from start to finish. Godzilla looks so real unlike the older Godzilla movies where it looked so fake.
25963,5,Negative,This was purchased as a present for Christmas. A remake of a SciFi movie
25993,5,Negative,Lots of shooting guns and destruction all over the nicest city in the world.
26009,5,Negative,"Get it on bluray, its the only way to watch it. Hopefully there still coming out with a trilogy of the version of Godzilla"
26014,5,Negative,I went the movie theatres and saw this movie and just had to buy it.
26023,5,Negative,Good ole Godzilla saving the city from evil creatures. Just like the old movies.
26035,5,Negative,First hour kinda slow but the anticipation to see Godzilla is crazy!
26038,5,Negative,"though was a remake of old one I didn't expect much, was I wrong"
26053,5,Negative,Saw this in IMAX and had to have it. Black Friday sale price was a no brainer.
26059,5,Negative,Saw it in the theater and knew I would buy the blu ray once it came out. Black Friday pricing made it a no brainer!
26073,5,Negative,Godzilla kicks a** and shows whos the boss in the movie
26077,5,Negative,"My grandson had to have this movie, he has watched it over and over"
26103,5,Negative,This was a movie in 3d. Just like I was hoping for.
26139,5,Negative,This is how a remake of Godzilla should be made!!1
26170,5,Negative,So the move beginnings with this history which I like. In typical Godzilla fashion it goes into the humanness of the monster Godzilla and his connection with humanity. A must see film!
26177,5,Negative,"If you are a Godzilla fan, this is the movie you have been waiting for!"
26196,5,Negative,I grew up watching godzilla movies and this is the one I have been waiting for!
26208,5,Negative,The movie is awesome???great features and recommended???
26209,5,Negative,These remind me of the brownie nut cookies Pepperidge Farm discontinued years ago that I miss.
26217,5,Negative,"I have tried absolutely everything to get the hard water residue off my dishwasher and dishes...and my condo has terrible hard water. I've used Cascade Platinum (this product shouldn't exist..it has ruined some of my favorite things, by the way!) as well as other pressed tablet products but it was always the same gritty leftover disgusting grossness all over my silverware and crystal and no matter how hot the water I used or how many ultra hot rinses, it just got worse. The Finish Orange Gelpacs have been awesome...I used them ages ago, but they have been really hard to find until a few weeks ago, and I'm so glad I started using them again. My hard water did not suddenly disappear, for any skeptics...my hair will attest to that! This stuff is amazing."
26229,4,Negative,I add ground turkey with this sauce and my entire family loves it. They can not believe that it's Ragu!
26235,5,Negative,Ragu is my 1 choice in sauce for spaghetti.
26236,5,Negative,I buy this item often. I do recommend this product
26237,5,Negative,My mom used this sauce when I was a child and this is the only sauce I use with my family.
26238,5,Negative,It's Ragu
26239,5,Negative,It was just the taste I was looking for!
26247,5,Negative,"Ragu Old World Style is not cooked with meat. Has fewer calories and less salt. Resealable container allows for multiple uses and easy pouring. I use this for pizza sauce, soup base, on pastas and polenta."
26258,5,Negative,"If you are looking for a sauce to heat-and-eat right out of the jar, I wouldn't recommend this one. If you are looking for a plain, well-made sauce base that you can customize, this is a good one."
26296,4,Negative,Where Does The Stargate Lead ? Maybe Into A Television Series ?
26328,5,Negative,Hard not to like what spawned the series SG1. Whenever I go back and watch my SG1s I have to watch the movie first. Now i have it on BluRay instead of a dual sided DVD that you have to flip halfway through.....Yes I actually still have some of those.
26351,5,Negative,Definitely not your average sci-fi flick. Well thought out direction.
26369,5,Negative,"The Stargate movie features Kurt Russell As U.S. Airforce Colonel Jack O??eil, James Spader As Archaeologist And linguist Dr. Daniel Jackson, Jaye Davidson as Ra, Alexis Cruz As Skaara, Mili Avital As Shauri, Eric Avari As Kasuf,And Viveca LAndfors As Dr. Catherine Langford etc.. The character of Dr. Daniel Jackson is helping Jack O??eil and other members of his groups towards a mission that they unexpectedly find trouble at first returning back to their preferred destination. What complicates matters is that the group ends up having little choice to help a group of people who are enslaved by a charismatic but evil ruler. One of the members unexpectedly develops romantic feelings for one of the locals which indirectly shape multiple plots of the movie."
26374,5,Negative,"Kurt russel represents america and blows up a very expensive space station, he did it with so much conviciton he shoulda won da oscar. My boy James spader in this flick, he still has hair and looks really scared, but he like indiana jones in this movie trine keep the peace. but some crazy alien egyptian aint having it, so guess what, they fight about it."
26390,5,Negative,THE STARGATE BLUE RAY MOVIE IS THE STORY OF WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPEN.
26421,5,Negative,I have always like this movie. I hope that this review process could be A LOT shorter.
26573,4,Negative,"My daughter in law keeps this in her diaper bag, now, being the grandma with the pool, I keep some here now too. I'll admit I haven't compared it to any other, but it works well."
26587,4,Negative,I like the product of aveeno
26593,4,Negative,"I started using this on my now 3 year old daughter when she was only a year and a half old, she has a slightly sensitive skin and this worked well for her no reaction at all. Four star because it's a little thick and hard to spread but nothing too much to a point that it bothers her."
26599,4,Negative,Works well. Doesn't break out baby's skin. Only complaint is it sometimes flakes.
26602,4,Negative,"My daughter has eczema and is extra sensitive to even eczema specific products (broke out with babyganics eczema formula) so I was hesitant to use this on her. However it turned out to be a decent option for her sensitive skin. The 3 times I have used it so far I did not notice any rash, bumps or itching (trust me my 7 month old daughter does not hesitate to scratch if something is irritating her skin). Despite other reviews she did not scratch any once applied, my only complaint is that it clumps and cakes up whether I use a thin layer/thick layer/well rubbed in. It looks as if someone lazily put cream on her and didnt bother to rub it in.Overall a descent product, did well in water, just wish it looked better after applied."
26612,5,Negative,Stays on and protects!
26615,5,Negative,I use this myself even though this is branded for babies as this sunscreen is less sticky than others I've used but not too watery at the same time.
26616,5,Negative,"I get bad reactions to most adult sunscreens (I think from the titanium dioxide), so switching to this made a world of difference. It's a bit thick in consistency, however, but works really well to protect my skin and keep it rash-free."
26618,5,Negative,I can rely on this product no matter what. I feel like my kids are well covered!
26622,5,Negative,"Goes on easy, stays on long! You can't go wrong with this product!!!"
26628,5,Negative,I use this myself even though this is branded for babies as this sunscreen is less sticky than others I've used but not too watery at the same time.
26631,5,Negative,I can rely on this product no matter what. I feel like my kids are well covered!
26632,5,Negative,"Goes on easy, stays on long! You can't go wrong with this product!!!"
26634,5,Negative,"I get bad reactions to most adult sunscreens (I think from the titanium dioxide), so switching to this made a world of difference. It's a bit thick in consistency, however, but works really well to protect my skin and keep it rash-free."
26645,5,Negative,Works as needed
26667,5,Negative,"Used it for my husband and myself for a 4 day backpacking trip. Not greasy, no sunburns. Will buy it again."
26682,5,Negative,this is the only sunscreen I've found that doesn't give me a rash
26683,5,Negative,Recently recommended by my oncological dermatologist. I am in my late 60's and have had various skin cancers removed over the last few years. I was frequently exposed to the sun during my childhood here in Southern California and am now paying the price. This sun protection is NOT just for babies.
26684,5,Negative,GOODGood productAuthenticity Guarantee
26689,5,Negative,No Issues!! prompt delivery. Use it everyday
26698,5,Negative,We were in Florida at the beach and Disney World for about 10 days with our 10 month old and I was so worried about her getting sunburned! Even in the Florida sun (and her being crazy pale just like me) all we needed was to apply this stuff once in the morning and we could walk around Disney World all day in the sun (for like 12 hours) and she never got a sunburn!
26736,5,Negative,rubs on skin well.
26750,5,Negative,baby loves it
26752,5,Negative,Does the job.
26753,5,Negative,"I have tried all the expensive, high end sunscreens for my sensitive skinned baby and this is the ONLY one that doesn't make him break out in rash. The Dr recommended it after we realized that all the other sunscreens I tried had Zinc in them. We thought that must be the ingredient he was allergic too not once has he ever broken out from this product. He is nearly 3 now and has been using the product for 2 years. I won't buy anything else for his skin."
26760,5,Negative,"Just one thing that I can tell you: this one has no water-mark, so it can last longer on your face!"
26761,4,Negative,it worked
26772,5,Negative,I've been waiting for this flavor to come back to my area FOREVER! InLove
26779,4,Negative,"Maybe not a fluffy as Reddenbacher, but a lot less price. i would recommend this item."
26806,5,Negative,"I started with her 30 minute walk DVD. Now, I have added this one for variety."
26846,5,Negative,Goes perfectly in my small kitchen and gave me extra work space while I prepared Christmas dinner.
26882,4,Negative,I would definitely recommend this product to my friends
26904,5,Negative,"Gread album, Aldean keeps killing it. Definitely recommend picking this up."
26908,5,Negative,"Jason Aldean has been on my ""must see"" list for a while now and after this release his status has been elevated to ""I am going to see him next time he is in town"" status. Groovin' all the way through the album!"
26922,5,Negative,15 songs that are barn burners....love all 15 of them!
26933,5,Negative,Love Jason Aldean. You will not be disappointed in purchasing this CD.
26952,5,Negative,Jason Andean come through again. Melodies are catchy and will have you singing along well after the cd has stopped.
26964,5,Negative,"Bought this for my wife, no complaints thusfar, sounds like a hit!"
26965,5,Negative,Excellant this review is a waste of my time really really
26974,5,Negative,I like the album. Would recommend if you like his music!!
26976,5,Negative,If you like country music I would recommend this CD.
26979,5,Negative,My wife...loves anything that Jason Aldean sings!!
26982,5,Negative,I bought it for my son for Christmas. He's a fan. .
26988,5,Negative,MY KINDA PARTY! JASON ALDEAN KICKS SOME SERIOUS !!
26995,5,Negative,I have found music online at bestbuy.com that I could not find at some of the stores .
27023,5,Negative,This is a must have CD if you are a Jason Aldean fan
27037,5,Negative,The man we got our surround TV from was GRATE all staff should take a class from him
27045,5,Negative,Jason did a job with this new CD!! You see a little softer side of him in a few songs!! Girls will like it!!
27055,5,Negative,Would recommend this to my friends and family members!
27057,5,Negative,You can never go wrong with Jason Aldean while kicking that diesel and handling them dirt roads
27090,5,Negative,I always choose Meguiar's when it comes to car care.
27100,4,Negative,"I have only been using this product for a few days. But I feel as if it is really stretching my hair out, and making it more flowy. Like it moves around a lot and is bouncy. I recently had Jheri curls done that did not really make my hair curly, I was a bit disappointed. My hair still is not exactly curly, but I think that when I put perm rods or rollers in my hair, this product will help make it that way. For now, I just like the softness it puts in my hair. Since my hair is thick, I use about two quarter size amounts of it."
27116,5,Negative,Husband grew up eating spam but when I buy can it's too much for him. He doesn't like to eat the same thing days in a row. This prout is just enough for him and none is wasted.
27140,4,Negative,Since my 3 year old can't take regular cold medicine yet. I run the vapor on her chest to soothe her breathing and cough and it works right away the lavender absolutely relaxes her into a deep sleep
27142,4,Negative,"If you would put this rub in a small tube like chapstick is I would give it a five star rating and buy it for everyone. I apply it to my neck, sinus cavity areas, on my temples for headache and my knee. I hate having to buy gloves to apply it so its not on my hands."
27143,4,Negative,"My family has been using this for years. However I would like to make one suggestion, make a roll-on version so that you don't get your hands greasy."
27144,4,Negative,I used this product on myself and my son when we were sick with a cold. It provided effective relief. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
27145,4,Negative,it works as it should. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
27147,5,Negative,We use vicks vaporub whenever any of us are sick and can't breathe. It really helps us sleep. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
27148,5,Negative,Thank you Vicks VapoRub. My entire household uses this product during those sick nights in bed This review was collected as part of a promotion.
27153,5,Negative,"I have used it for the infection from ingrown toe nails. It draws the infection and swelling out, so that it can be clipped out. I also use it to draw the infection from boils out. Just put it on then cover with a bandage.Use every night till boil opens."
27157,5,Negative,"I found my baby Vicks from years ago (when my firstborn was an infant) to use with my 2 1/2 month old. He had a bad cold so I applied it to his chest, neck, and feet. Immediately I could tell he was sleeping a lot quieter and peaceably."
27160,5,Negative,"Terrible cough have not slept in 5 nites. I tried cough syrups and a prescription. Last nite I got vicks put it all over my neck covered loosely with a towel. After about an hour of the vapors clearing me out.. Slept all nite. Thanks to my Mother, when we were kids used this method"
27161,5,Negative,Amaxing product
27162,5,Negative,Been using this for years
27170,5,Negative,"I am 18 weeks pregnant and have had a horrible case of bronchitis for the past week. There is very little I can take that is safe for the baby so I haven't slept very much and am miserable from coughing. Today, a friend suggested I use Vick's VapoRub and I am SHOCKED at how much it has helped control my cough and soothe my irritated airway. THANK YOU for this awesome product!"
27176,5,Negative,Much less money than drug store.
27177,5,Negative,Vicks works wonders
27178,5,Negative,I've used Vaporub since I was a kid. It's the very best when you have a really bad cold. Rub on your chest and inhale the vapor and it really helps you feel better. I'm very disappointed that they don't carry this product in the stores anymore.
27182,5,Negative,"You can always trust Vicks Vapor Rub. It helps you breath so much better when you have a head cold. Myself, I like the smell and feel of it's cooling menthol."
27187,5,Negative,cant go wrong with this
27190,5,Negative,"Always used this as a child and now as an adult, especially when you get a cold rub it on your chest at night and it really helps to take away the stuffy nose and cough."
27191,5,Negative,"I used this about a week and a half ago went I had a cold to get some relief from my coughing, sneezing, sinus pressure, and runny nose. I just rubbed some on my chest and it helped me out a lot. It's makes it feel like it just clears my sinuses out. This is just like I remember when I was a child and my mom would rub it on my chest when I was sick. I received this free to test out. This review was collected as part of a promotion."
27192,5,Negative,Baby girl is almost 9 months old and was having trouble sleeping because she is coughing. Applied some baby rub on chest and back and saw an instant effect. Time to get some sleep now yay
27198,5,Negative,Love love love vicks. When my son was little and even now we use this when he is sick. My husband was sick not to long ago and he used it as well. Vicks works wonders. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
27200,5,Negative,Nothing soothes better than Vicks. Definitely always have on hand. Couldn't get through a cold without it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
27201,5,Negative,I recently used this when I was having some confestion issues due to a sinus infection. It worked wonders at relieving my congestion and actually allowed me to sleep through the night. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
27205,5,Negative,my mom put this on me as a kid have always use it. now I use it on my grandchildren This review was collected as part of a promotion.
27208,5,Negative,"Have dry , cracked feet rub on feet and put on a pair of cotton socks... wake to unbelivably smoother feet. I use at least twice a week.....FYI"
27210,5,Negative,"We use this in cold dry weather. We take a dab of this salve, rub it inside your nose to keep it moist. In cold or dry weather, if your nose gets too dry, it can will bleed. So to avoid this issue we use Vics. We have done this for years it works very well."
27211,5,Negative,I was covered in Vicks when I had colds as a kid and the stuff still works when I get colds. I always keep the Vicks on hand.
27215,5,Negative,When my 4 months baby is restless or feels pains it comes to my rescue all the time.
27216,5,Negative,"My 11 month old has been fussy for two days with a cold and cough. He hasn't been sleeping, I rubbed some baby Vicks on his chest he quit coughing and fell asleep. It's a life saver for this sleep deprived momma."
27217,5,Negative,"Nobody likes a sleepless night! A stuffy nose can wake you up which can be a double threat. If you can't sleep it weakens your immunities. Next thing you know, you have a cold, a headache, or you're exhausted the next day. Dab a small amount of Vicks on your upper lip under your nose and you will likely feel an immediate clearing of your stuffy nose. Vicks does dry and lose its vaporizing effect. So you could be wakened again by the same problem. Then, just grab your trusty Vicks and dab it again. As often as you need it all night long."
27219,5,Negative,"Lately with spring allergies I have a terrible, dry night time cough. This is the only thing that will give me relief so that I can fall asleep. Although the scent is strong, the lemon scent is nice."

I was amazed.With my own base coat, after a few days of normal household chores the polish would peel and chip.With Barielle Nail Rebuilding Protein as a base coat, it lasts almost 2 weeks with just a little touch up.My nails look so nice with just Barielle Nail Rebuilding Protein I often don't bother with colored polish. See photo.I highly recommend both products."

29241,4,Negative,"i received this product thanks to influenster for testing purposes but this is my honest review. I was skeptical with this conditioner because its main function is to repair the split ends, dont get me wrong, i needed that, but since my hair is so oily i was scare it would just made it worst because of all the moisturizing, but i didnt so im happy with the results.

29328,4,Negative,"I received this product free from Influenster for trial purposes. I noticed a difference in my oily roots and dry ends in only a matter of a few washes. The shampoo is silky and the conditioner was a little more thick with less lather than I typically prefer. Overall, I would definitely recommended this product!
